These are pieces of information that we suggest you research before you
begin game play.  You can read this page at the game prompt by typing 'info'.

1.  All the basic information we think you need to play the game is 
    available through the HELP command. Type HELP by itself to see a list
    of topics which can then be read with the HELP command.

2.  You must read the disclaimer by typing HELP DISCLAIMER. You should
    also read the rules by typing HELP RULES.
    ***WARNING:  IGNORANCE IS NO DEFENSE ***

3.  New players should read HELP NEWBIE. Then read all the topics it points
    you to. Even old players can probably learn a few things here.

The roads are long and tiring, be prepared.  The game is designed for
experienced MUD players; it is full of subtle dangers, so keep your
eyes open.  Inexperienced players are welcomed to try to conquer the
game -- we have done our best to accommodate you as well.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

cannot hide from danger. Death floats on the air, creeps through the
window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[36mNowhere[0;37m
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

brick walls conceal you in their deep shadows. A foul stench drifts from
some trash and refuse piled up against the walls at spots. Save for the
awful smell and some trash blown along by the wind, there appears to be no
one in the area.

High up in the wall you spy some closed windows.
Looking east:
The alley appears to end at a brick wall further east.
Looking south:
A sturdy brick wall.

Looking up:
You see nothing special.
Looking down:
The ground is filthy with dirt and things more foul.

[36mA Dark Deserted Alley[0;37m
    High brick walls to either side engulf you within their shadow. The
alley is dark and eerily silent. You can imagine this would be a perfect
place for a mugger to lie in wait. Out of the corner of your eye, you spy
movement. Spinning around, it turns out be a rat scurrying into the trash.
The smell of refuse mixes with the bloody stench of Death Row drifting in
further west.

[36mCorner of a Building[0;37m
    You find yourself at the northwestern corner of the Balifor Jail. The
front steps of the large brick building lie just to the south. The jail has
become a busy place. A steady stream of guards leave and enter through the
reinforced double doors. The smell of blood drifts in from Death Row and
the Executioners Block just off further west. Leading east is a dark alley.

[36mAt the Balifor Jail[0;37m
    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare

    This is where bounty hunters are rewarded (usually) for bringing in
wanted criminals. It's a bit cramped in this small office. Dull yellow
paint flakes from the bare walls. The only furniture is an old desk
scattered with slips of paper and some stiff chairs arranged around it. A
half closed window to the north lets in some of the stench from Death Row.

[36mAt the Balifor Jail[0;37m
    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    It would be wise to keep a hand on your purse in this place. Certainly,
there is no love lost between the filthy street urchins who are being
taught how to relieve a dummy of a purse. The dummy is covered in small
bells, the ring of a bell signals failure and back to a life of begging.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of

one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    The great city of Port Balifor apparently also has a nastier side to
it. From here you can see a great expanse of waste and vermin to the south
where the city dump has taken over the land. Old fish crates and carcasses
of long dead animals leave a particularly unpleasant smell in the air.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

    The road has the feel and smells of death row, yet leads towards big
buildings to the north. There are no signs of life here, a few symbols of
death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    The bank of Balifor looks fairly rundown. Not surprising, since the
local populace doesn't earn enough money to bother putting it in banks.
Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window and
door, looks enthusiastic enough. A small sign has been stuck to the desk.

your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mDeath Row[0;37m
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The great city of Port Balifor apparently also has a nastier side to

of long dead animals leave a particularly unpleasant smell in the air.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    The main hall of the temple begins here near the entrance. There are
torches that line each wall, ensuring a well-lit walkway. Faint sounds of
footsteps can be heard to the east, but there is nothing there but a wall.
The walls are red in tint with sigils on each side resembling the God of
Greed, Hiddukel himself. The path leads north, further into the vestibule
or south back to the entryway of the temple.

It being considerably smaller for one, as well as it being extremely quiet

    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The road has the feel and smells of death row, yet leads towards big
buildings to the north. There are no signs of life here, a few symbols of
death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

[36mTemple Road[0;37m
    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

[36mOutside the Evil Temple[0;37m
    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

[36mOutside the Evil Temple[0;37m
    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

    The road has the feel and smells of death row, yet leads towards big

death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    The great city of Port Balifor apparently also has a nastier side to
it. From here you can see a great expanse of waste and vermin to the south
where the city dump has taken over the land. Old fish crates and carcasses
of long dead animals leave a particularly unpleasant smell in the air.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mDeath Row[0;37m
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The road has the feel and smells of death row, yet leads towards big
buildings to the north. There are no signs of life here, a few symbols of
death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

[36mOutside the Evil Temple[0;37m
    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to the
north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.

torches that line each wall, ensuring a well-lit walkway. Faint sounds of
footsteps can be heard to the east, but there is nothing there but a wall.
The walls are red in tint with sigils on each side resembling the God of
Greed, Hiddukel himself. The path leads north, further into the vestibule

    The distinct smell of feces pours heavily into the air non-stop. This
cell shows signs of endless physical torture as if the stench wasn't
torturous enough. It can only be imagined of the amounts of pain and agony
the prisoner of this cell has undergone. There are deep scratch marks and
pieces of human fingernails on the cell walls. Whoever was held here must
have really been trying to escape this horrendous treatment. The only exit
seems to be west through the iron door.

    This is the entryway to the temple. It is lit dimly by a few scattered
torches, which barely reflect off what appears to be the remains of several
humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red Door
south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to the
north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.

[36mOutside the Evil Temple[0;37m
    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

[36mTemple Road[0;37m
    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

    The road has the feel and smells of death row, yet leads towards big
buildings to the north. There are no signs of life here, a few symbols of
death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden

your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the

into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The great city of Port Balifor apparently also has a nastier side to
it. From here you can see a great expanse of waste and vermin to the south

of long dead animals leave a particularly unpleasant smell in the air.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits

west is a meeting room.
