[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here,

with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here,

with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m

Trains can be spent in several ways, all of which require that you are at
a trainer inside your guild. Type "[0;37mhelp guild[0m" to find directions.
You can use trains to increase your stats, learn additional skills/spells, or
increase your hp/mana/move.
 
The best stats to train first are the primary and secondary stats for your
class. You can find these stats in the "help <class>" help file. Increasing
these stats will result in you gaining more practices per level, which can
be used to practice skills/spells or converted into more trains. See
"[0;37mhelp gain[0m" for more information.
  
A training session may also be applied to your [1;31mhp, mana, or moves,[0m and
there is a [1;31mlevel-dependent maximum[0m number of trains listed in your 'score'.
Your TOTAL hp/mana/mv is dependent on your level, class, race, the number of
times you have trained that attribute, and the following stats:  DIS, CON for hp,
WIS for mana, and AGI for moves.
 
In addition to the hard capped number of trains that you are allowed to invest
into hp/mana/move (level based), there is a soft cap, which you can read about
in "[0;37mhelp softcap[0m".
 
** Artificial constructs train differently, see "[0;37mhelp construct_details[0m".

At your guild, you can practice skills, train stats, and gain new abilities.
 
[0;37mWIZARDS[0m:  mages, illusionists, necromancers
Your powers lie in your ability to use magic to create and/or alter things
to use to your advantage. Arch-Bishop Talitha, who is found [0;37m2N, W, S, W, U, N[0m
from recall, helps you master the abilites you need for survival..
 
[0;37mCLERICS[0m:  clerics, monks, templars  
Your powers come from your closeness with religion and ability to use your
understanding of the way things really are. In your guild, found [0;37mSW, W, U[0m
from recall, Desmond trains you to believe in your own powers.
 
[0;37mFIGHTERS[0m:  warriors, gladiators, samurai, paladin
Your powers are mostly physical, although your true strength comes from
within. In your guild, found [0;37m2S, 2W[0m from recall, Santiago trains you to
be at one with the weapons you wield.
 
[0;37mROGUES[0m: thieves, assassins, ninjas, bards
Your powers come from your ability to move when you want, and in the way
you want to move. Quick, crafy, and sneaky, like your guild master Silas
Longbow, you are looked down upon by the Holy Order of Templars. You can
find your guild [0;37m2S, E, N, E, open south, S[0m
 
[0;37mGUNSLINGERS[0m:  Your powers lie solely in the almost spiritual bond between
you and your gun. In your guild, found [0;37m2S E S 2E S[0m from recall, Roland
awaits to instill in you the confidence you need to prosper in Aarchon.
 
[0;37mRANGERS[0m:  As you are an adventurer of great independence, you dwell upon
that trait and can even eventually do without the guidance of your
guild master. In the beginning, however, you may learn much from Sara
the Bear who resides on the very outer perimeter of town: [0;37m3N, W, S[0m.

  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

bit of lag imposed just so you don't spam yourself crazy.

[1;37mCommunicating and Channels[0m
  There are many ways to communicate in Aarchon, and here you will learn
the basics. To start, the '[0;36mchannels[0m' command will show you a list of all
channels available for use. 
 
[0;37mSay <text>[0m only displays in the current room. [0;33mTell <player> <text>[0m will 
communicate only with a single player. Additionally you can use [0;33mreply <text>[0m 
to respond to the last person who sent you a tell.
 
If you don't like the chatter on the channels, you can turn them off just by 
typing the name of the channel (or turn them all off with '[0;36mquiet[0m'.
 
The [1;36mnewbie[0m channel is a great place to ask questions if you are new.
 
The '[0;36mplayback[0m' command can show communication history for various channels.

[1;37mShop, Eat, and Sleep[0m
  In this room is Billy, he sells food and drinks. To see what he has to sell, 
type '[0;36mlist[0m'. To find out more information on the item, type '[0;36mbrowse <item>[0m' To buy 
something from Billy, type '[0;36mbuy <item>[0m'. To sell something back to him, 
type '[0;36msell <item>[0m'. Try [1;32mbuy cake[0m and [1;32mbuy soda[0m.
 
To eat the cake, use '[0;36meat cake[0m' and to drink the soda use '[0;36mdrink soda[0m'. Also, 
now's a good time to learn how to regenerate.  While sleeping (type '[1;32msleep[0m'), your 
hp (hit points) and mana (magic points) recover more quickly. If you sleep for
a long period of time, you will continually fall into a deeper sleep, which
increases the rate at which you heal. When you want to wake up, you can type
'[1;32mstand[0m' or '[1;32mwake[0m'.
 
When you're done here, go [1;32mup[0m to learn about improving your character.

[1;37mExperience, Training, and Practicing[0m
  When characters kill something, complete a quest, or improve their abilities 
through constant use out in the world, they gain two types of experience 
points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their
respective help files: '[0;37mhelp practice[0m' '[0;37mhelp train[0m'

Trains can be spent in several ways, all of which require that you are at
a trainer inside your guild. Type "[0;37mhelp guild[0m" to find directions.
You can use trains to increase your stats, learn additional skills/spells, or
increase your hp/mana/move.
 
The best stats to train first are the primary and secondary stats for your
class. You can find these stats in the "help <class>" help file. Increasing
these stats will result in you gaining more practices per level, which can
be used to practice skills/spells or converted into more trains. See
"[0;37mhelp gain[0m" for more information.
  
A training session may also be applied to your [1;31mhp, mana, or moves,[0m and
there is a [1;31mlevel-dependent maximum[0m number of trains listed in your 'score'.
Your TOTAL hp/mana/mv is dependent on your level, class, race, the number of
times you have trained that attribute, and the following stats:  DIS, CON for hp,
WIS for mana, and AGI for moves.
 
In addition to the hard capped number of trains that you are allowed to invest
into hp/mana/move (level based), there is a soft cap, which you can read about
in "[0;37mhelp softcap[0m".

Trains can be spent in several ways, all of which require that you are at
a trainer inside your guild. Type "[0;37mhelp guild[0m" to find directions.
You can use trains to increase your stats, learn additional skills/spells, or
increase your hp/mana/move.
 
The best stats to train first are the primary and secondary stats for your
class. You can find these stats in the "help <class>" help file. Increasing
these stats will result in you gaining more practices per level, which can
be used to practice skills/spells or converted into more trains. See
"[0;37mhelp gain[0m" for more information.
  
A training session may also be applied to your [1;31mhp, mana, or moves,[0m and
there is a [1;31mlevel-dependent maximum[0m number of trains listed in your 'score'.
Your TOTAL hp/mana/mv is dependent on your level, class, race, the number of
times you have trained that attribute, and the following stats:  DIS, CON for hp,
WIS for mana, and AGI for moves.
 
In addition to the hard capped number of trains that you are allowed to invest
into hp/mana/move (level based), there is a soft cap, which you can read about
in "[0;37mhelp softcap[0m".
 
** Artificial constructs train differently, see "[0;37mhelp construct_details[0m".

[1;37mClosing Remarks[0m
  Congratulations, you've completed the orientation! You've learned the 
fundamentals, and there's still lots to learn about, but you've got more
than enough to start with. A few closing remarks: First, locks. Some doors
are locked.  To unlock doors you need to a) find the right key and b) type
'[0;36munlock <direction>[0m'. Also, you are wearing armor, and can find even more to 
wear. Type '[0;36mequipment[0m' or just '[0;36meq[0m' to see what you are 
currently wearing. Type '[0;36meq all[0m' to see which slots you have not yet filled.
 
Type '[0;36minventory[0m' to see what items you are carrying. To wear something in your
inventory, type "wear <object>". To pick up something off the ground, type 
'get <object>'. Usually a single keyword works. Lastly, if you get lost in 
this big world, you can usually type '[0;36mrecall[0m' to come back to the center of 
Bastion. From there, just type up and you'll be back at The Initiation. Good 
luck, and if you need help, just ask on the [1;36mNEWBIE[0m channel. You can type
'[0;36mwho[0m' to see which players are online and visible. Go up to return to the first 
room of the Initiation (crazy, isn't it?!)

[1;37mThe Initiation[0m
  Welcome to Aarchon! You find yourself standing atop a small platform in
the midst of numerous support beams, crisscrossing wires, butresses and
other girdings. Below you is the churning square of the grand city of
Bastion. 
 
To the [1;32mnorth[0m is an entrance into this structure, The Initiation. 
The Initiation is more than a newbie school. It is a great place to gain a few
levels and find equipment. 
 
Absolute newcomers to MUDs, should go [1;32mup[0m for a quick orientation. If you 
are a blind, visually impaired, or mobile user, read '[0;36mhelp screen reader[0m' for 
information on commands and help files that you may find beneficial.

[1;37mNewbie Orientation: Premise[0m
  In the next few rooms, you'll learn how to move around the world, talk,
fight, buy items, and do everything you need to do in order to interact with
the MUD and its players. If you want to know more, you can read the help files 
(just type '[0;36mhelp[0m" to get a list of topics.)  Also, feel free to ask other 
players for help by using the '[1;36mnewbie[0m' channel. You can type '[1;36mnewbie 
<question>[0m' to use this channel. Type '[1;32mup[0m' again to move to the next 
orientation room. If you need to re-read anything, type '[0;36mlook[0m" to see the 
room again.

[1;37mMoving Around[0m
  The world is organized into a series of rooms, and you can move around by 
typing the direction you want to move. You can move in in the following
directions: [0;37mNorth, South, East, West, Up, Down, Northeast, Northwest,
Southeast, Southwest[0m. 
 
The directions can be abbreviated to [0;33mn, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw[0m.
 
You can type [0;36mexits[0m to see the available exits in each room.
 
You can input multiple directions at a time using the [0;36mwalk[0m command.

Around you are some rooms to try this out. These rooms don't take you far 
away, so don't worry about getting lost. When you're done, come back to this 
room and go [1;32mup[0m to the next orientation station.

[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

At your guild, you can practice skills, train stats, and gain new abilities.
 
[0;37mWIZARDS[0m:  mages, illusionists, necromancers
Your powers lie in your ability to use magic to create and/or alter things
to use to your advantage. Arch-Bishop Talitha, who is found [0;37m2N, W, S, W, U, N[0m
from recall, helps you master the abilites you need for survival..
 
[0;37mCLERICS[0m:  clerics, monks, templars  
Your powers come from your closeness with religion and ability to use your
understanding of the way things really are. In your guild, found [0;37mSW, W, U[0m
from recall, Desmond trains you to believe in your own powers.
 
[0;37mFIGHTERS[0m:  warriors, gladiators, samurai, paladin
Your powers are mostly physical, although your true strength comes from
within. In your guild, found [0;37m2S, 2W[0m from recall, Santiago trains you to
be at one with the weapons you wield.
 
[0;37mROGUES[0m: thieves, assassins, ninjas, bards
Your powers come from your ability to move when you want, and in the way
you want to move. Quick, crafy, and sneaky, like your guild master Silas
Longbow, you are looked down upon by the Holy Order of Templars. You can
find your guild [0;37m2S, E, N, E, open south, S[0m
 
[0;37mGUNSLINGERS[0m:  Your powers lie solely in the almost spiritual bond between
you and your gun. In your guild, found [0;37m2S E S 2E S[0m from recall, Roland
awaits to instill in you the confidence you need to prosper in Aarchon.
 
[0;37mRANGERS[0m:  As you are an adventurer of great independence, you dwell upon
that trait and can even eventually do without the guidance of your
guild master. In the beginning, however, you may learn much from Sara

At your guild, you can practice skills, train stats, and gain new abilities.
 
[0;37mWIZARDS[0m:  mages, illusionists, necromancers
Your powers lie in your ability to use magic to create and/or alter things
to use to your advantage. Arch-Bishop Talitha, who is found [0;37m2N, W, S, W, U, N[0m
from recall, helps you master the abilites you need for survival..
 
[0;37mCLERICS[0m:  clerics, monks, templars  
Your powers come from your closeness with religion and ability to use your
understanding of the way things really are. In your guild, found [0;37mSW, W, U[0m
from recall, Desmond trains you to believe in your own powers.
 
[0;37mFIGHTERS[0m:  warriors, gladiators, samurai, paladin
Your powers are mostly physical, although your true strength comes from
within. In your guild, found [0;37m2S, 2W[0m from recall, Santiago trains you to
be at one with the weapons you wield.
 
[0;37mROGUES[0m: thieves, assassins, ninjas, bards
Your powers come from your ability to move when you want, and in the way
you want to move. Quick, crafy, and sneaky, like your guild master Silas
Longbow, you are looked down upon by the Holy Order of Templars. You can
find your guild [0;37m2S, E, N, E, open south, S[0m
 
[0;37mGUNSLINGERS[0m:  Your powers lie solely in the almost spiritual bond between
you and your gun. In your guild, found [0;37m2S E S 2E S[0m from recall, Roland
awaits to instill in you the confidence you need to prosper in Aarchon.
 
[0;37mRANGERS[0m:  As you are an adventurer of great independence, you dwell upon
that trait and can even eventually do without the guidance of your
guild master. In the beginning, however, you may learn much from Sara
the Bear who resides on the very outer perimeter of town: [0;37m3N, W, S[0m.

[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

Syntax: [0;36mstance <stance_name>[0m

[0;36mstance[0m with no argument returns you to the default fighting style
(i.e. stanceless, thus costing no moves per round).

Stances cost move points every round (or 'pulse') of combat. The cost as
[0mlisted in [1;36mSHOWSKILL <stance_name>[0m is the cost when you are 100% effective 
with the stance. The cost is significantly greater at lower percentages.

You can list all of your stances, and the current cost to you, by typing
[1;32mstancelist[0m. Some stances are for use with weapons (marked "w"), and some 
are for use during hand-to-hand combat (marked "m" for martial arts).
 
Weaponless stances generally have a characteristic damage type, as listed in
their individual help files, but stances using weapons do not change the damtype.

[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

cast spellcasting Magic
Syntax: [0;36mcast <spell> <target>[0m
 
The <target> is optional on most spells. In many cases spells will use smart
targetting (especially during combat), meaning that if you: cast 'cure light'
and don't specify the target, it will target yourself rather than your enemy.
Combat spells on the other hand will automatically target your opponent.
 
If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critical'. Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate spell names as well (so c 'cure cri' will work)
 
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw. The 
effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the saving 
throw successfully. Some skills and spells modify saves, such as the unicorn
or inquisition stance.
 
The skill in a spell determines the chance of spell failure (0-50%), mana cost
(100-200%), casting time (100-200%) and spell level (50-100%).
 
It is possible to cast non-combat spells (such as sanctuary) during combat.
However, the caster can make no physical attacks while casting, and suffers a
chance of spell failure for each opponent attacking him.
 
It is also possible to cast a spell at reduced spell level. The syntax for
this is [0;36mcast <spell> @level <target>[0m.
 
There are some standard formulas for spell damage outlined below:
 
1) Spell damage is a function of casting cost, and spell lag, proportional to
sqrt(lag * cost) * (33 + spell level)
 
You can find the values for spells using the "showskill <spell name>" command.

Syntax: [0;36mcast <spell> <target>[0m
 
The <target> is optional on most spells. In many cases spells will use smart
targetting (especially during combat), meaning that if you: cast 'cure light'
and don't specify the target, it will target yourself rather than your enemy.
Combat spells on the other hand will automatically target your opponent.
 
If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critical'. Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate spell names as well (so c 'cure cri' will work)
 
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw. The 
effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the saving 
throw successfully. Some skills and spells modify saves, such as the unicorn
or inquisition stance.
 
The skill in a spell determines the chance of spell failure (0-50%), mana cost
(100-200%), casting time (100-200%) and spell level (50-100%).
 
It is possible to cast non-combat spells (such as sanctuary) during combat.
However, the caster can make no physical attacks while casting, and suffers a
chance of spell failure for each opponent attacking him.
 
It is also possible to cast a spell at reduced spell level. The syntax for
this is [0;36mcast <spell> @level <target>[0m.

2) Area spells are multiplied by a factor of 0.6, and some individual spells
may apply different factors.
 
3) Touch spells which require an attack roll (burning hands, chill touch, 
shocking grasp) have a factor of 1.4 and add a burning/freezing/shock effect.

[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

[1;37mCommunicating and Channels[0m
  There are many ways to communicate in Aarchon, and here you will learn
the basics. To start, the '[0;36mchannels[0m' command will show you a list of all
channels available for use. 
 
[0;37mSay <text>[0m only displays in the current room. [0;33mTell <player> <text>[0m will 
communicate only with a single player. Additionally you can use [0;33mreply <text>[0m 
to respond to the last person who sent you a tell.
 
If you don't like the chatter on the channels, you can turn them off just by 
typing the name of the channel (or turn them all off with '[0;36mquiet[0m'.
 
The [1;36mnewbie[0m channel is a great place to ask questions if you are new.
 
The '[0;36mplayback[0m' command can show communication history for various channels.

[1;37mShop, Eat, and Sleep[0m
  In this room is Billy, he sells food and drinks. To see what he has to sell, 
type '[0;36mlist[0m'. To find out more information on the item, type '[0;36mbrowse <item>[0m' To buy 
something from Billy, type '[0;36mbuy <item>[0m'. To sell something back to him, 
type '[0;36msell <item>[0m'. Try [1;32mbuy cake[0m and [1;32mbuy soda[0m.
 
To eat the cake, use '[0;36meat cake[0m' and to drink the soda use '[0;36mdrink soda[0m'. Also, 
now's a good time to learn how to regenerate.  While sleeping (type '[1;32msleep[0m'), your 
hp (hit points) and mana (magic points) recover more quickly. If you sleep for
a long period of time, you will continually fall into a deeper sleep, which
increases the rate at which you heal. When you want to wake up, you can type
'[1;32mstand[0m' or '[1;32mwake[0m'.
 
When you're done here, go [1;32mup[0m to learn about improving your character.

points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their
respective help files: '[0;37mhelp practice[0m' '[0;37mhelp train[0m'

Normal practice allows a character to train a skill up to 75%. Further 
increases can be gained through use of the skill, or through extra hard 
practice. Each hard practice will increase a skill by 1%, with costs starting 
at 1 practice session for skills currently at 75%, and increasing up to 
25 practice sessions to increase a skill from 99% to 100%.
 
[0;37mHard practice is not recommended for new characters.[0m

meditation
A magic-user with this ability will recover spent mana points more quickly 
while in a restful state. The concentration needed in order to meditate is 
only able to be attained while resting, not sleeping or standing. It is an 
automatic skill, although some people like to try and force it to happen 
(by typing 'meditate'). Studies have shown that there is no noticeable 
difference in meditative intensity, but some practitioners claim that proper 
posture while meditating enhances the experience.

guild
At your guild, you can practice skills, train stats, and gain new abilities.
 
[0;37mWIZARDS[0m:  mages, illusionists, necromancers
Your powers lie in your ability to use magic to create and/or alter things
to use to your advantage. Arch-Bishop Talitha, who is found [0;37m2N, W, S, W, U, N[0m
from recall, helps you master the abilites you need for survival..
 
[0;37mCLERICS[0m:  clerics, monks, templars  
Your powers come from your closeness with religion and ability to use your
understanding of the way things really are. In your guild, found [0;37mSW, W, U[0m
from recall, Desmond trains you to believe in your own powers.
 
[0;37mFIGHTERS[0m:  warriors, gladiators, samurai, paladin
Your powers are mostly physical, although your true strength comes from
within. In your guild, found [0;37m2S, 2W[0m from recall, Santiago trains you to
be at one with the weapons you wield.
 
[0;37mROGUES[0m: thieves, assassins, ninjas, bards
Your powers come from your ability to move when you want, and in the way
you want to move. Quick, crafy, and sneaky, like your guild master Silas
Longbow, you are looked down upon by the Holy Order of Templars. You can
find your guild [0;37m2S, E, N, E, open south, S[0m
 
[0;37mGUNSLINGERS[0m:  Your powers lie solely in the almost spiritual bond between
you and your gun. In your guild, found [0;37m2S E S 2E S[0m from recall, Roland
awaits to instill in you the confidence you need to prosper in Aarchon.
 
[0;37mRANGERS[0m:  As you are an adventurer of great independence, you dwell upon
that trait and can even eventually do without the guidance of your
guild master. In the beginning, however, you may learn much from Sara
the Bear who resides on the very outer perimeter of town: [0;37m3N, W, S[0m.

[1;37mExperience, Training, and Practicing[0m
  When characters kill something, complete a quest, or improve their abilities 
through constant use out in the world, they gain two types of experience 
points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their
respective help files: '[0;37mhelp practice[0m' '[0;37mhelp train[0m'

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all the
skills and spells available to you. You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell. Your learning
percentage varies from 1% (unpracticed) to a maximum of 75%. You must be at
your guild to practice. You can find your guild's location in [0;37mhelp guild[0m. 
 
The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.
 
Practices are gained automatically with each level gained. The number of 
practices gained is determined by the primary and secondary stats of each
class. The higher your stats are in these categories, the more practices 
you will gain with each level.
 
The formula for determining practices gained is:
[0;37mPrimary/30 + secondary/45 + secondary2/45[0m
 
Your practice screen will always show skills on a scale of 1 to 100%,
rather than your effective %, which is shown with skills or spells commands.
 
PRACTICE FIELD will convert about half of your field experience to real
experience, depending on wisdom. This costs 1 practice.
 
See [0;37mhelp gain[0m for more information on how to spend practices.

[1;37mExperience, Training, and Practicing[0m
  When characters kill something, complete a quest, or improve their abilities 
through constant use out in the world, they gain two types of experience 
points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their
respective help files: '[0;37mhelp practice[0m' '[0;37mhelp train[0m'

  When characters kill something, complete a quest, or improve their abilities 
through constant use out in the world, they gain two types of experience 
points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their

  In this room is Billy, he sells food and drinks. To see what he has to sell, 
type '[0;36mlist[0m'. To find out more information on the item, type '[0;36mbrowse <item>[0m' To buy 
something from Billy, type '[0;36mbuy <item>[0m'. To sell something back to him, 
type '[0;36msell <item>[0m'. Try [1;32mbuy cake[0m and [1;32mbuy soda[0m.
 
To eat the cake, use '[0;36meat cake[0m' and to drink the soda use '[0;36mdrink soda[0m'. Also, 
now's a good time to learn how to regenerate.  While sleeping (type '[1;32msleep[0m'), your 
hp (hit points) and mana (magic points) recover more quickly. If you sleep for

  There are many ways to communicate in Aarchon, and here you will learn
the basics. To start, the '[0;36mchannels[0m' command will show you a list of all
channels available for use. 
 
[0;37mSay <text>[0m only displays in the current room. [0;33mTell <player> <text>[0m will 
communicate only with a single player. Additionally you can use [0;33mreply <text>[0m 
to respond to the last person who sent you a tell.
 
If you don't like the chatter on the channels, you can turn them off just by 
typing the name of the channel (or turn them all off with '[0;36mquiet[0m'.
 
The [1;36mnewbie[0m channel is a great place to ask questions if you are new.
 
The '[0;36mplayback[0m' command can show communication history for various channels.

[1;37mKilling, Killing, and more Killing![0m
  You're probably ready to kill something by now. Combat is quite detailed here, 
with lots of skills and spells to squash opponents with, but it's easy enough 
to start a fight. Simply type '[0;36mkill[0m' followed by the name of what you want 
to kill. You will automatically start to hack away. There should be a little 
goblin in this room for you to kill. Type '[0;36mkill goblin[0m (or simply '[0;36mk gob[0m' 
to put the thing out of its misery. 
 
The '[0;36maction[0m' command is a useful tool for fighting, so be sure to read 
[0;37mhelp action[0m. You can use kick at any level so try setting [0;36maction kick[0m 
now! When you're done with your wanton slaughter, go up to the next station 
and learn to talk to people for a change!

[1;37mCommunicating and Channels[0m
  There are many ways to communicate in Aarchon, and here you will learn
the basics. To start, the '[0;36mchannels[0m' command will show you a list of all
channels available for use. 
 
[0;37mSay <text>[0m only displays in the current room. [0;33mTell <player> <text>[0m will 
communicate only with a single player. Additionally you can use [0;33mreply <text>[0m 
to respond to the last person who sent you a tell.
 
If you don't like the chatter on the channels, you can turn them off just by 
typing the name of the channel (or turn them all off with '[0;36mquiet[0m'.
 
The [1;36mnewbie[0m channel is a great place to ask questions if you are new.
 
The '[0;36mplayback[0m' command can show communication history for various channels.

[1;37mShop, Eat, and Sleep[0m
  In this room is Billy, he sells food and drinks. To see what he has to sell, 
type '[0;36mlist[0m'. To find out more information on the item, type '[0;36mbrowse <item>[0m' To buy 
something from Billy, type '[0;36mbuy <item>[0m'. To sell something back to him, 
type '[0;36msell <item>[0m'. Try [1;32mbuy cake[0m and [1;32mbuy soda[0m.
 
To eat the cake, use '[0;36meat cake[0m' and to drink the soda use '[0;36mdrink soda[0m'. Also, 
now's a good time to learn how to regenerate.  While sleeping (type '[1;32msleep[0m'), your 
hp (hit points) and mana (magic points) recover more quickly. If you sleep for
a long period of time, you will continually fall into a deeper sleep, which
increases the rate at which you heal. When you want to wake up, you can type
'[1;32mstand[0m' or '[1;32mwake[0m'.
 
When you're done here, go [1;32mup[0m to learn about improving your character.

[1;37mExperience, Training, and Practicing[0m
  When characters kill something, complete a quest, or improve their abilities 
through constant use out in the world, they gain two types of experience 
points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their
respective help files: '[0;37mhelp practice[0m' '[0;37mhelp train[0m'

When typing [0;36mgroup[0m you may see a list of letters toward the end of the line
for each member in your group. These letters are quick indicators of popular
buffs / spells that are currently cast or available to be cast on your group.
 
The letters represent the following:
R(escue) B(less) F(ly) G(iant strength) H(aste) S(anctuary) W(arcry) (fren)Z(y)
rbfghswz
 
If a letter is displayed in [1;31mlower case red[0m it means that you are capable of
casting that buff on yourself or the group member the letter is displayed for.
 
If a letter is displayed in [1;37mupper case white[0m it means that you or that group
member is currently affected by that buff.
 
If no letter is present, it means that the buff is not cast, and you are not
capable of casting that buff.
 
Example output of "group" command:
Astark's group:
[ 99 War] Astark    9304/9304  hp  1130/1130  mn  4997/4997  mv    [1;31mfgh w[0m       0 etl
[ 99 Cle] Duffy     7277/7277  hp 12777/12847 mn  1873/1873  mv   [1;37mBF[1;31mgh[1;37mS[1;31mw[0m      0 etl
 
In this example, Astark is not affected by any buffs, but can cast fly,
giant strength, haste, and war cry on himself and also on Duffy (except
for fly, as Duffy is already affected by fly). Duffy is affected by bless,
fly, and sanctuary.
 
 
On a separate note, healers such as "Mercy" (found SW, W of recall, at the Temple)
are capable of casting buffs on you for a price. Use the [0;36mspellup[0m command
for a list.

Syntax: [0;36mcast <spell> <target>[0m
 
The <target> is optional on most spells. In many cases spells will use smart
targetting (especially during combat), meaning that if you: cast 'cure light'
and don't specify the target, it will target yourself rather than your enemy.
Combat spells on the other hand will automatically target your opponent.
 
If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critical'. Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate spell names as well (so c 'cure cri' will work)
 
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw. The 
effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the saving 
throw successfully. Some skills and spells modify saves, such as the unicorn
or inquisition stance.
 
The skill in a spell determines the chance of spell failure (0-50%), mana cost
(100-200%), casting time (100-200%) and spell level (50-100%).
 
It is possible to cast non-combat spells (such as sanctuary) during combat.
However, the caster can make no physical attacks while casting, and suffers a
chance of spell failure for each opponent attacking him.
 
It is also possible to cast a spell at reduced spell level. The syntax for
this is [0;36mcast <spell> @level <target>[0m.
 
There are some standard formulas for spell damage outlined below:
 
1) Spell damage is a function of casting cost, and spell lag, proportional to
sqrt(lag * cost) * (33 + spell level)
 
You can find the values for spells using the "showskill <spell name>" command.

[1;37mExperience, Training, and Practicing[0m
  When characters kill something, complete a quest, or improve their abilities 
through constant use out in the world, they gain two types of experience 
points: 'applied' goes directly towards raising your level, and 'field' is 
temporarily stored so you absorb your life-lessons more slowly. If you 
'[0;36mrest[0m' or '[0;36msit[0m', you can absorb your field experience into your applied
experience more quickly.
 
When you gain enough experience, you raise a level! To see your current level,
how many experience points you need for the next, as well as loads of other 
useful details about your character, type '[0;36mscore[0m'. Each level you gain 
makes you a bit more powerful in fighting and spellcasting, gives you more 
hp/mana/movement, and gives you one train, and a few practices. These trains
and practices can be cashed in at certain trainers, like the Wise Guy in
this very room. You can read details on how practices and trains work in their
respective help files: '[0;37mhelp practice[0m' '[0;37mhelp train[0m'

[1;37mClosing Remarks[0m
  Congratulations, you've completed the orientation! You've learned the 
fundamentals, and there's still lots to learn about, but you've got more
than enough to start with. A few closing remarks: First, locks. Some doors
are locked.  To unlock doors you need to a) find the right key and b) type
'[0;36munlock <direction>[0m'. Also, you are wearing armor, and can find even more to 
wear. Type '[0;36mequipment[0m' or just '[0;36meq[0m' to see what you are 
currently wearing. Type '[0;36meq all[0m' to see which slots you have not yet filled.
 
Type '[0;36minventory[0m' to see what items you are carrying. To wear something in your
inventory, type "wear <object>". To pick up something off the ground, type 
'get <object>'. Usually a single keyword works. Lastly, if you get lost in 
this big world, you can usually type '[0;36mrecall[0m' to come back to the center of 
Bastion. From there, just type up and you'll be back at The Initiation. Good 
luck, and if you need help, just ask on the [1;36mNEWBIE[0m channel. You can type
'[0;36mwho[0m' to see which players are online and visible. Go up to return to the first 
room of the Initiation (crazy, isn't it?!)

  Welcome to Aarchon! You find yourself standing atop a small platform in
the midst of numerous support beams, crisscrossing wires, butresses and
other girdings. Below you is the churning square of the grand city of
Bastion. 
 
To the [1;32mnorth[0m is an entrance into this structure, The Initiation. 
The Initiation is more than a newbie school. It is a great place to gain a few
levels and find equipment. 
 
Absolute newcomers to MUDs, should go [1;32mup[0m for a quick orientation. If you 
are a blind, visually impaired, or mobile user, read '[0;36mhelp screen reader[0m' for

[1;37mBefore the gauntlet[0m
  You stand before the entrance to The Gauntlet, which presents you with eight
foes to overcome for experience and equipment. Aarchon is a MUD best described
as eclectic. Besides the usual fantasy elements, there are plenty of other 
things going on, and the challenges just ahead reflect that. To the [1;32msouth[0m 
is the way back out to the entrance of the Initiation. On the wall is a sign 
(type '[1;33mlook sign[0m' to read it). There will be many such signs in this area, 
explaining important things every mudder should know. If you want to learn 
more commands and features specific to Aarchon, move '[1;32mup[0m' from here.

[1;37mFeatures![0m
  Most every MUD offers something unique for its players.  Here you will
learn about a few of the features that Aarchon has to offer you.  Some
features are only available to certain classes, and some you may not
experience until reaching a higher level, but they are listed here for your
convenience anyway.  
 
[1;36mAchievements[0m - A continuously growing system that rewards players for
reaching certain milestones. Type "achievements" or "ach" for a list of
those you have (and have not) completed.
 
[1;36mStances[0m - Each class has a minimum of one stance available to use
during combat that benefits them in some way. Stances use move points and
have many benefits. Some disarm your opponents, others increase your damage,
and some will automatically cast spells for you each round.
 
[1;36mOffense[0m - Similar to stances, offensive fighting allows your character
to deal more damage, but consumes moves. This effect is enhanced while in
a berserker rage, but requires no training for basic use.
 
[1;36mTattoos[0m - Players can spend quest points on tattoos that will add bonuses
to your stats, Hp/Mana/Move, armor class, and more. There are two tiers of
tattoos (to cater to casual and competitive players), and various ways to

[1;37mFeatures![0m
  Most every MUD offers something unique for its players.  Here you will
learn about a few of the features that Aarchon has to offer you.  Some
features are only available to certain classes, and some you may not
experience until reaching a higher level, but they are listed here for your
convenience anyway.  
 
[1;36mAchievements[0m - A continuously growing system that rewards players for
reaching certain milestones. Type "achievements" or "ach" for a list of
those you have (and have not) completed.
 
[1;36mStances[0m - Each class has a minimum of one stance available to use
during combat that benefits them in some way. Stances use move points and
have many benefits. Some disarm your opponents, others increase your damage,
and some will automatically cast spells for you each round.
 
[1;36mOffense[0m - Similar to stances, offensive fighting allows your character
to deal more damage, but consumes moves. This effect is enhanced while in
a berserker rage, but requires no training for basic use.
 
[1;36mTattoos[0m - Players can spend quest points on tattoos that will add bonuses
to your stats, Hp/Mana/Move, armor class, and more. There are two tiers of
tattoos (to cater to casual and competitive players), and various ways to
reap their full benefit.
 
[1;36mCrafting[0m - Some classes have been given the crafting skill, which will
allow them to disassemble armor and weapons for materials, and then turn them
back into other weapons and armor pieces to use.
 
[1;36mAlchemy[0m - Some classes can brew powerful potions to help them in their
adventures. Herbs are used for brewing and grow in various regions across
the realm. They can be found, bought, and sold by any player.

Magic tattos can be bought at the tattoo shop. Once bought, they  will stay on
your body for all time (even if you die or remort), unless you choose to have 
them removed at the shop. [0;33mFor tattoos that are removed you will receive a 
90% refund.[0m
 
Unlike ordinary tattoos, magic tattoos can grant special powers to their wearer.
The powers added increase as the wearer increases in level, however they are
only effective while nothing or translucent equipment is worn over the tattoo.
If translucent equipment is worn, the effective level for determining tattoo
bonuses (see below) is (character level + equipment level)/2.
 
The 10 first tattoos add (10+lvl)% of their listed power until level 90. At 
level 90+ they will add an additional 10% for each level above 90, up to a 
total of 200% at level 100.
 
The next 10 tattoos (those for 2500qp) add an additional bonus which is
independent of the wearers level. This bonus is listed in brackets and is 
applied at all times, regardless of whether translucent equipment is being 
worn above them or not.
 
The following tattoos are available and add the listed affect at level 90:
(the bonus affect is listed in [brackets] afterwards)
 
Bear........+200 hp
Snake.......+200 mana
Bunny.......+200 move
Tiger.......+8 physical stats, +50 hp, +50 move

offense offensive calm
Most fighters attack aggressively, moving quickly into better striking positions
and following through with vigorous blows. While these efforts can mean the
difference between victory and defeat, they are also tiring.

While fighting offensively, each attack made, whether successful or not, consumes
movement points. When a character runs out of movement, they automatically stop
fighting offensively, dealing reduced damage.
 
Characters in a berserker rage (as induced by frenzy, berserk, drunken fury,
and shan-ya) fight even more aggressively than normal, dealing yet more damage
but also tiring more quickly.
 
The movement cost per attack depends on the weapon used. See the table below
for a full breakdown. 

  Type of   | Move Cost | Move Cost
  Attack    | Offensive | Berserking
  ------------------------------------------
  Unarmed   |    1      |  2
  1-Handed  |    1.5    |  3
  2-Handed  |    2      |  4
  Bow       |    2.5    |  5
  Burst     |    1      |  2
  Semi-Auto |    1      |  2
  Full Auto |    1      |  2

The damage bonus provided is 2*cost + 15% normally, and 2*cost + 25% while in
a berserker rage (+35% with the '[0;37mfervent rage[0m' skill).
 
To preserve their energy, a character can decide to fight more calmly, using 
the '[0;37mcalm[0m' command. This works similar to the '[0;37mwimpy[0m' command (see

  [0m
[1;36mRemort[0m - Our remort system is primarily puzzle based, meaning you will
need to work your way through a unique quest all on your own. Once you
remort you will be able to select a new (more powerful race) and continue
your adventures, reaching a new high level with each remort.
 
[1;36mAarchon Estates[0m - Wealthy players who like to make a permanent
mark for themselves, can purchase a home to be placed almost anywhere.
 
[1;36mMini-Quests[0m - We are continuously adding new mini-quests to areas all
across Aarchon. You can type "areas" to see a list of all areas in the
game, including a column that displays the number of mini-quests found in
each of those zones. Mini-quests are generally mob-program based quests
that may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to complete. Some
can be repeated, some cannot.
 
[1;36mLeaderboards[0m - Several player stats are tracked here, and those results
are recorded on the leaderboards. The "[0;37mlboard[0m" command will show you more.

[1;37mUseful Commands[0m
  If you've made it this far, you have likely already learned enough about
the basic movement commands and are now looking for something more advanced
to help you out.  Here are a few commands that most every player should
know.  
 
[0;37mConsider[0m - Use "consider <mob name>" or "con" for short, to size up
against your opponent and find out if you stand a chance of winning. The
command is not perfect, as some classes have a more advanced version in
the form of the [0;33m'estimate'[0m skill.
 
[0;37mAction[0m - You can use the "action" command to automate the use of a
skill in combat. For example "action kick" will make your character use
the kick command each round of combat. This is useful because it stops
you from spamming the same attack, and prevents you from being "lagged"
while waiting for the commands to clear the queue.
 
[0;37mShowskill[0m - The "showskill <skill/spell>" command will give you some
detailed information about the specified skill or spell. You can type
"showskill recall" to see an example. It will tell you which classes can
learn the skill, how much it costs each class, and how well each class
can learn it. You will also see the amount of 'lag' the skill or spell
generates. 12 lag is equal to 1 round of combat.

[1;37mMore Useful Commands[0m
  [0m
[0;37mEq all[0m - The "eq all" command will show you all of the equipment that
you are wearing, but it will also show which slots you have not yet filled.
Not all classes can use shields or multiple weapons, so it is not uncommon
to have a few empty slots.
 
[0;37mAutolist[0m - The "autolist" command will give you a list of all actions
that can be automated, and certain toggles that can be enabled or disabled.
Typing "autoass" for example, will ensure that when you have grouped with
another player you will automatically assist them in combat.
 
[0;37mScore[0m - The score command is common in most any MUD, but you have the
ability to slightly customize some of the information that it displays.
 
[0;37mPlayback[0m - If you've missed part of a discussion on one of the public
channels, or if you can no longer scroll back far enough to see something
that was said to you, type "playback [# of lines]" to see a history up to
70 lines long of what has been recently said.

Welcome newbies! The purpose of this guide is to give you some tips and a
point in the right direction so that you don't feel completely lost in the
world of Aarchon. Please keep in mind that the players on the MUD are
generally quite accepting of questions, so don't ever hesitate to ask for
help. Often times they will help you gather equipment, complete your quests,
or give you a spell-up -- if you wish. This brief guide is not all inclusive
but should be a good resource for anyone new to Aarchon.

Welcome newbies! The purpose of this guide is to give you some tips and a
point in the right direction so that you don't feel completely lost in the
world of Aarchon. Please keep in mind that the players on the MUD are
generally quite accepting of questions, so don't ever hesitate to ask for
help. Often times they will help you gather equipment, complete your quests,
or give you a spell-up -- if you wish. This brief guide is not all inclusive
but should be a good resource for anyone new to Aarchon.

[1;32mIdentifying and Loring Items[0m
 
Some classes have the lore, weapons lore, or identify skills/spells, but
they are not available to everyone. There are several ways you can learn
more about the items that you carry.
 
1. The "compare" command will give a -general- idea as to whether one item
is better than another.
 
2. The "identify" command can be used at -any- shop in the game. The shop
keeper will effectively lore the item for you for a very small fee.
 
3. Wandering Sages who roam the town of Bastion will lore items for free.
Simple hand them the item. They will lore it and return it to you.
 
4. The "browse" command can be used at shops to have the shopkeeper lore the
item for you, for free. This is only for items that are "listed" for sale.

wires and beams that keep the floating palace aloft over the square.  Quite
sensibly, they keep this door locked, so you'll probably need some sort of

  This room is clearly the livingroom of America's favorite animated

room, and Homer thinks over all the new people he's killed lately.  When
you've killed Homer, read the [1;37msign[0m.

  To the north is a small utility door that leads out to the system of
wires and beams that keep the floating palace aloft over the square.  Quite
sensibly, they keep this door locked, so you'll probably need some sort of

square below you, or you can climb back up into the Initiation chambers.

wires and beams that keep the floating palace aloft over the square.  Quite
sensibly, they keep this door locked, so you'll probably need some sort of

Welcome newbies! The purpose of this guide is to give you some tips and a
point in the right direction so that you don't feel completely lost in the
world of Aarchon. Please keep in mind that the players on the MUD are
generally quite accepting of questions, so don't ever hesitate to ask for
help. Often times they will help you gather equipment, complete your quests,
or give you a spell-up -- if you wish. This brief guide is not all inclusive
but should be a good resource for anyone new to Aarchon.

[1;37mGuilds[0m
------
There are currently six guilds, all of which are found in the city of Bastion. 
Each guild corresponds to one or more classes and represents where you go to 
train your stats, practice your skills, and learn new ones. You can read up 
on each guild through the "help guild" help file. Here is a list of directions 
to each.
 
[0;36mWizard's Guild[0m - (Mages, Illusionists, Necromancers) - 2n,w,s,w,u,n
 
[0;36mCleric's Guild[0m - (Clerics, Monks, Templars) - sw,w,u
 
[0;36mFighter's Guild[0m - (Warriors, Gladiators, Samurais, Paladins) - 2s,2w
 
[0;36mRogue's Guild[0m - (Ninjas, Thieves, Assassins, Bards) - 2s,e,n,e,open south,2s

[0;36mGunslinger Guild[0m - (Gunslingers) - 2s,e,s,2e,s
 
 
When Rangers gain the skill "introspection", they can train and practice their
skills anywhere. No guild is required.

Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your clan's Patron for miraculous transportation from where
you are, back to the Palace Square in Bastion. '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing)  
NOTE: Your recall skill will always remain at 50%

RECALL has a movement cost of 5x your level.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms. Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

Welcome newbies! The purpose of this guide is to give you some tips and a
point in the right direction so that you don't feel completely lost in the
world of Aarchon. Please keep in mind that the players on the MUD are
generally quite accepting of questions, so don't ever hesitate to ask for
help. Often times they will help you gather equipment, complete your quests,
or give you a spell-up -- if you wish. This brief guide is not all inclusive
but should be a good resource for anyone new to Aarchon. 
 
The following sections are available:

There are almost 100 zones in Aarchon, very few of which are "stock" zones. You 
can explore freely if you'd like, but this will give you a general idea of which 
areas to check out for each level range. This is by no means all inclusive. 
All directions are available on the "Maps and Dirs" section of the website.

subclasses ascend ascent
After reaching the highest possible level a mortal can gain (i.e. level 100),
character can ascend. Ascending has the following consequences:
 
- Rebirth as a level 1 remort 0 character.
- ETL increases by 500 + 100 * ascent level (+200 cross-class).
 
+ Specialization as a subclass, which grants bonus skills.
+ Mastery point maximum increases by 1 each remort, capped at 100.
 
There is no limit to how often a character may ascent, but after 5 ascents no
additional benefits are gained (due to the cap on mastery points).
Ascended characters are considered 6 levels higher for pkill range purposes,
regardless of their number of ascents.
 
Character can only have one subclass. This is chosen at the time of ascent,
and can only be changed for the first 3 remorts or by re-ascending.
After ascending, remort repeat is free for the first 3 remorts.
 
Subclasses grant bonus skills. These function exactly like race skills.
The [1;33mshowsubclass[0m command provides details on available subclasses.
After ascending twice, characters may chose any subclass, regardless of
their class, and certain bonus skills are granted. Chosing a subclass you
do not normally have access to incurs an additional +200 ETL.

  You stand on a small platform overlooking the palace square.  To the
south is a small utility door leading back into the Initiation.  All around
you are beams, buttressess, and wires that keep the floating palace
suspended above the palace square below.  Although it'll be tricky, it's
possible to move between the supports to ferret out any enemies you may
encounter.  If you're in trouble, go down at any time to the safety of the
palace square.

  You stand on a small platform overlooking the palace square.  To the
south is a small utility door leading back into the Initiation.  All around
you are beams, buttressess, and wires that keep the floating palace
suspended above the palace square below.  Although it'll be tricky, it's
possible to move between the supports to ferret out any enemies you may
encounter.  If you're in trouble, go down at any time to the safety of the
palace square.

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all the
skills and spells available to you. You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell. Your learning
percentage varies from 1% (unpracticed) to a maximum of 75%. You must be at
your guild to practice. You can find your guild's location in [0;37mhelp guild[0m. 
 
The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.
 
Practices are gained automatically with each level gained. The number of 
practices gained is determined by the primary and secondary stats of each
class. The higher your stats are in these categories, the more practices 
you will gain with each level.
 
The formula for determining practices gained is:
[0;37mPrimary/30 + secondary/45 + secondary2/45[0m
 
Your practice screen will always show skills on a scale of 1 to 100%,
rather than your effective %, which is shown with skills or spells commands.
 
PRACTICE FIELD will convert about half of your field experience to real
experience, depending on wisdom. This costs 1 practice.
 
See [0;37mhelp gain[0m for more information on how to spend practices.

GAIN
The gain command is used to learn new skills, and can be done at your
guild. The following options can be used with gain:
 
gain list:     list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain <name>:   add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert:  turns 10 practices into one training session
gain revert:   turns 1 train into 8 practice sessions
gain losehp:   convert 2 trains spent on hp back into one training session
gain losemana: convert 2 trains spent on mana back into one training session
gain losemove: convert 2 trains spent on move back into one training session
 
The amount of hp/mana/moves earned by training depends on your discipline.
 
Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see help train)
