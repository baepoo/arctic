[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    The alley runs parallel with traders street, and is really nothing more
than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High Street.
The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the two.
You feel unusually nervous as you walk here, and small movements in the
shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears are

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty
odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, passing
between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy
fishermen.

building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disgarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting

[36mThe Gilded Parrot Inn[0;37m
    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disgarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

[36mOn a Coastside Road[0;37m
    This road follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. A glittering expanse of
blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that
sways the few trees that manage to grow along this road. To the north you
see a crossroads, while south of here the road follows the sea to Port
Balifor.

    Cutting a jagged path along the grassy fields near the sea, this road
follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. The air is filled with the crying of
seagulls and the thick, saline smell of saltwater. It is well traveled by
merchants and sailors, as well as the occasional band of thieves.

    The coast of the Khurman Sea is just south of this well-travelled road.
The road slowly bends, wide enough so that many wagons can pass by each
other. The sounds of waves crashing and gulls crying drifts in on a dry
breeze from the southwest, and the air is filled with the saline smell of
saltwater. The occasional fisherman drifts idly by, and the sea is usually
peaceful.

alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the

of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies down a

near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from

     The soothing chirps of birds and the clatter of chipmunks greets you
as you enter the dense forest, far north of Balifor, nestled in the Loft
Hills Valley. Off into the distance, small woodland creatures playfully
leap from tree to tree, not paying you any attention. A small intermittent
stream twists and turns through the bottom of the small valley, beckoning
you onward. Also, a few bizarre looking birds fly overhead, occasionally
breaking the dense forest canopy. The pleasant scent of the forest wafts in
with a gentle breeze, harshly contrasting with the arid desert of the
Ak-Khan, far to the east.

much larger here, with carvings in them, denoting presence of something
unbeknownst to you. The path, once fairly visible, now fades off and
becomes almost unnoticable to the unaided eye.

giving them a faint tinge. Off into the southern distance, you see a rustle
in the treetops and hear the whiz of an arrow, striking the tree adjacent

[36mA Path in the Woods[0;37m
    The trees have been cleared here creating a path from Neraka. Travel is
possible through a thin wood to the west and north, or along the path east.
A stream thin enough to step across flows down a hill from the south,
cutting its way across this path. Along the stream to the south a
treacherous looking path leads up the hill, but access to it is blocked by
thick brush and probably too steep to climb anyway. Neraka lies a short
march to the east, its crumbling buildings and neglected square can be seen
from here.

of Neraka. There are faint trails between the tents in all directions.

    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

    Bits of ashes blow across the road, emissions from the huge volcano to
the south west. The road skirts the base of the volcano, and its potholes
become treacherous as they slowly fill up with soft ash and become hidden.
All around other bare jagged peaks tower about, casting harsh shadows over
the land.

[36mA Muddy Den[0;37m
    Overrun with vegetation and mud, this area is more a hole in the ground
than an actual den. The area is very well-protected and appears to be a
lookout post of sorts. The lack of heavy traffic through this area is
evidenced by the rampant growth of flora all around. Obviously something is
causing the common merchant caravans of Krynn to avoid this section of the
world. A small settlement of sorts is visible to the north.

passes through the north gate of Balifor. A tall city wall surrounds the
port on its three open sides, an indication of its trading wealth and
prosperous people. The sea off Balifor is reputedly vicious for the
inexperienced, defending the town well.
