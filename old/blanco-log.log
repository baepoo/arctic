    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the two.
You feel unusually nervous as you walk here, and small movements in the
shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears are

    Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the

travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north

    Cutting a jagged path along the grassy fields near the sea, this road

seagulls and the thick, saline smell of saltwater. It is well traveled by
merchants and sailors, as well as the occasional band of thieves.

    The coast of the Khurman Sea is just south of this well-travelled road.
The road slowly bends, wide enough so that many wagons can pass by each
other. The sounds of waves crashing and gulls crying drifts in on a dry
breeze from the southwest, and the air is filled with the saline smell of
saltwater. The occasional fisherman drifts idly by, and the sea is usually
peaceful.

crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.A small grove of trees thrives just off to the side of the road.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.[1mBlanco the Male Kender is standing here. (flying)

    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards

an eerie glow to everything in the area. Small clouds of dust roll across
the floor, disturbed after having been settled for a great many years. The
clawprints of draconians crisscross the floor, as though they had been
searching desperately for something here. Not far to the east is a set of
golden double doors, identical to the pair you can see beyond the statue of
Mishakal to the west.[31m[1m

the floor, disturbed after having been settled for a great many years. The
