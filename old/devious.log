Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[36mNowhere[0;37m
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

When first created, all characters are linked to the specific internet
domain that they are logged in from. By default, a character cannot be 
logged in from any other domain. This acts as a security measure for all
characters so that other people cannot log on characters that are not their
own.

If you wish to log a character on from multiple domains (for example, if you
have one internet connection from home, and another from work), you will want
to use the OPTIONS DOMAINS command. It allows you to specify up to five
separate domains that your character can be linked to. If you choose, you may
also turn off domain checking entirely for your character. If you simply
need to have your domain link cleared, in the event that you are changing
from one internet connection to another, please speak to a God (level 33)
or higher immortal for a domain reset.

Note that the ability to log a character on from multiple domains in no way
modifies the rules against any character sharing between multiple players.
See HELP RULES for further details.

most of the other huts. Despite this fact, the path here seems worn and

unmaintained, with hairline cracks all along its surface. Trash is
littered about the area, and you can see a few spots where an individual
or two decided to let it all go.

be readily seen travelling in and out from afar. A strange sort of writing
is inscribed above the doors. Small, arid shrubbery lines the edge of the
building, adding a sense of nobility and care. The path here leads north

thick layer of sand on the tools and unfinished clay, you can tell that it
has been quite some time since anything has bothered with this area. A
large pile of hardened sand sits in the back of the room, unused in the

this hut is oval, longways from east to west. There is an opening to the

be kept in this room. Additionally, a few crude beds have been crammed in

[36mA Family Hut[0;37m
     A large Brog family seems to inhabit this hut. The filth is
overwhelming. It seems that the Brog are not bothered by the stench, nor
do they condemn it. The large dome covering that serves as the walls of
this hut is oval, longways from east to west. There is an opening to the
north that appears to lead to an unfinished room. A large, clay table sits
here, obviously being the place where the familiy has its meals.

     The crude trail continues to meander through the settlement, dodging
the odd huts with a turn here and a detour there. The relentless heat
seems to press upon your body, almost goading you on through the
settlement to find some sort of relief. A large hut lies to your north,
although it seems to be only partially constructed. The path continues to
the east and west from here.

     Any sort of movement in this arid desert seems to billow up clouds of
sand, obscuring the desolate scenery from your vision. You can see a few

between the crudely fashioned huts. One such hut, looking no different
than the dozens of others in the settlement, lies to your north. The trail
turns to your south towards more huts.

bordering between freshly killed food, and the old stench of death.

blows in from the south, most likely from the Southern Courrain Ocean.
However, it offers no relief - just more stale, dry air.

can spot little broglings scuttling about with their parents frequently
here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other
hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard, cold
stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various huts
and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of survival.
In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a
couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your

     You are now nearing what seems to be the center of the Brog camp. You
can spot little broglings scuttling about with their parents frequently
here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other
hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard, cold
stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various huts
and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

     As far as town centers go, you are fairly sure that this is not the

that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of survival.
In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a
couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

accustomed to intruders, and have taught themselves the best way to treat
them.

between the crudely fashioned huts. One such hut, looking no different
than the dozens of others in the settlement, lies to your north. The trail
turns to your south towards more huts.

    The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
carried on the sea breeze. The occasional flash of white in the sky
confirms the presence of gulls. To the west lies Guild Road, where
adventurers of many guilds can find training in their arts.

more than packed dirt, created over the years by the thousands of
travellers that have walked this path before you. Sparse vegetation and a
lack of trees make your journey a rather mundane one. A faint breeze
rustles the high grass around the road and ruffles your hair.

to the disorder with the tools, two simple, neatly made beds are also
here. Perhaps one of the Brog that lives here is not quite as neat as the

that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of survival.
In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a
couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

in the ground. Some wander off the trail, while others just stop suddenly.
However, they all serve as a reminder to you of how the Brog must be
accustomed to intruders, and have taught themselves the best way to treat
them.

     To the north you can see a hut decorated with all sorts of junk.
Animal carcasses, random chunks of metal, and strips of cloth are all on
display for visitors to gape in awe at. Small offerings of berries and
twigs have been left at the doorstop for one reason or another. The
entrance to the hut lies to the north, while the path continues east and
west.

     The path here brings you to even more huts scattered across the sand
dunes and amongst the sandy trails. One hut in particular stands out to
your south. Unlike many of the others, it seems neat and well kept. The
path leading up to it is nicely brushed, and the walls of its dome are in
good condition and well maintained. The path here leads east and north.

[36mThe Center of the Settlement[0;37m
     As far as town centers go, you are fairly sure that this is not the
fanciest of them. A very deep, crude well has been constructed here so
that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of survival.
In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a
couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

     You are now nearing what seems to be the center of the Brog camp. You

here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other
hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard, cold
stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various huts
and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

     It is now apparent that you are at the entrance to the Brog
settlement. Large domes are scattered about, their strange shape make you
feel only more alien to the strange landscape. A roughly hewn path winds
between the crudely fashioned huts. One such hut, looking no different
than the dozens of others in the settlement, lies to your north. The trail
turns to your south towards more huts.

     The crude trail continues to meander through the settlement, dodging
the odd huts with a turn here and a detour there. The relentless heat
seems to press upon your body, almost goading you on through the
settlement to find some sort of relief. A large hut lies to your north,
although it seems to be only partially constructed. The path continues to
the east and west from here.

     Any sort of movement in this arid desert seems to billow up clouds of
sand, obscuring the desolate scenery from your vision. You can see a few
Brog milling about the settlement here. The path begins to look a bit more
intentional here. It takes a turn to the east from the north, but not
before it comes to a small hut to the south.

     It is now apparent that you are at the entrance to the Brog
settlement. Large domes are scattered about, their strange shape make you
feel only more alien to the strange landscape. A roughly hewn path winds
between the crudely fashioned huts. One such hut, looking no different
than the dozens of others in the settlement, lies to your north. The trail
turns to your south towards more huts.

bordering between freshly killed food, and the old stench of death.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
