    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along
the opposite walls. Every odd interval you come across a torch stuck in the
stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few
will ever see the light of day again.

been built into them for passing through the prisoner's daily rations of

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

[36mA Turn in the Tunnel[0;37m
    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

northwest. Its rounded base protrudes into this room, with a sturdy metal
door allowing access to its obsidian walls. Rising up to and through the
ceiling, the tower almost looks ancient and must have been erected first,
with the building constructed around it. There is a strange odor in the air

another peculiar one that is hard to finger and becomes increasingly strong
nearer the tower.

in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

[36mBefore a Temple of Takhisis[0;37m
    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

    A dark aura clouds the hallway east of here, where the black doors of a
temple radiate wickedness. The stone wall opens up in an archway to the
south, which leads into a sloppy mess hall, and to the west the hallway
twists off heading south. Light breezes whisper in through slat-like
windows in the northern wall, making the stench of rotten food from the
south more bearable.

in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

[36mA Dank Cellar[0;37m
    Thick cracks full of crumbling rock run through the stony walls, and
the air is heavy with wetness. The walls are carved from the earth, and
partially supported by rotting wooden beams that are wedged between the
floor and ceiling. An iron staircase creaks and strains under it's own
weight, sending shrill echoes through the cavernous cellar. Just barely
able to light the room, a few near extinguished torches flicker on the
walls. West of here the cellar intersects, heading off in two more
directions, and through the stairwell you can climb up to the first
subterranean floor of the building.

    Two halls run perpendicular through the cellar here, one due north and

on the southern wall, joined by a few that have burnt out and no longer
serve any purpose. The inherent dampness in the air is obvious here, grungy
water trickles through a narrow crack to the west and spills onto the
floor. Thriving in the moisture, little insects burrow through the rotting
wood beams along the ceiling and walls, adding to their struggle to support
the massive building overhead.

here, some of them stand only midway up the wall having collapsed under
their own weight. The cellar's air is fetid with the smell of rot and
decay, making you think twice before taking a deep breath.

Strange noises shortly catch your attention to the east, while the only
other direction to go is into an intersection west of here.

and further down the hall another cell resides behind the northern wall. A

Lining the eastern and western walls are racks and tables covered with
dozens of cruel instruments, most of them made of hard metal and lined with
barbs and serrated edges, and all of them smeared with the blood of former
captives. This at one time must have been a cell, the room's frame that
leads into a hallway south is missing chunks of stone where iron bars were

[36mThe End of the Cellblock[0;37m
    Issuing from a room to the north, a horrid stench lingers in the air.
Pinpointing it's source is no trouble, even from here you can see dozens of
torture devices coated in blood throughout the neighboring room. Marking
the end of the cell block to your east a single candle burns brightly in a
sconce, lighting this end of the hall. The stone wall is smooth to your
south, and leads straight west to continue the block.

    The only item of interest here is a dark cell to the north, shadows
obstruct the corners and through its rusted iron bars its hard to see much
of anything. Stone walls continue toward the west, where another cell
stands, and to the east where this hall ends. An eerie rhythmic sound
echoes in your ears from somewhere close by though it's hard to place.

    Curiously the southern wall here looks like it was once a cell door,
but is now sealed with stone and mortar. Directly north of it is an equally
bizarre sight, a steel cell door frame is laden with magical runes and
scrawlings. Two torches on opposing sides of the room keep the hall lit,
and further down the hall another cell resides behind the northern wall. A
bit to the west the cell block ends at an intersection.

[36mA Dank Cellar[0;37m
    Three choices lay before you at this intersection. Towards the north
you see no immediate danger and south of here the cellar appears to be
empty save the little insects that live here, while to the east a row of
cells lines the hallway. Decaying timbers barely support the heavy ceiling
here, some of them stand only midway up the wall having collapsed under
their own weight. The cellar's air is fetid with the smell of rot and
decay, making you think twice before taking a deep breath.

    Two halls run perpendicular through the cellar here, one due north and
the other eastward. Shedding just enough light to see is a flickering torch
on the southern wall, joined by a few that have burnt out and no longer
serve any purpose. The inherent dampness in the air is obvious here, grungy
water trickles through a narrow crack to the west and spills onto the
floor. Thriving in the moisture, little insects burrow through the rotting
wood beams along the ceiling and walls, adding to their struggle to support
the massive building overhead.

    Thick cracks full of crumbling rock run through the stony walls, and
the air is heavy with wetness. The walls are carved from the earth, and
partially supported by rotting wooden beams that are wedged between the
floor and ceiling. An iron staircase creaks and strains under it's own
weight, sending shrill echoes through the cavernous cellar. Just barely
able to light the room, a few near extinguished torches flicker on the
walls. West of here the cellar intersects, heading off in two more
directions, and through the stairwell you can climb up to the first
subterranean floor of the building.

is plentiful here, provided by a few newly lit torches attached to the
walls though the air is smokey and a bit smothering.

    Near the northern wall a stairway leads down a small opening, protected
by metal railings. The training grounds spread out to your south and west,
and to the east a crude wall and leather tarp serve as walls for a
temporary medical facility. Sharp bits of metal from broken swords and
armor slide across the stone floor as you step into them, producing a
series of metallic clangs. It's hard to open your eyes and not see a streak
of blood across something in this area, and the air stinks of it.

    Broken sword hilts and blades lie scattered around the floor here, the
by-product of trainees that haven't yet learned the techniques of fighting.
The wooden boards of the northern wall are rutted through with gaping
slashes and splintered dents, as are the low hanging beams of the ceiling.
From here the grounds continue on to the east, where a stairwell leads to
another floor, and toward the south you can access the rest of the
facility. Curving to meet the wooden wall to the west is the base of an
ominous tower, built of smooth glass-like obsidian.

    Evil radiates from the black walls, this is obviously the home of
powerful magics. Sorcery is laced into the obsidian around you, the walls
gleam with an unnatural light that fills the tower without need for torches
or candles. From here the tower's inner walls curve around toward the west
where a stairway rises high up to the next floor, and to your south a flat
wall forces you to choose from heading to an intersection west or through
the door to your east which leads out of the tower.

    The tower's top floor expands toward the south here, it's outer walls
following a curve to the north and east. Through what would be the center
of the top floor, a shiny black wall rises up a few feet to your west and
bisects the tower. Thousands of sigils dedicated to the dark god Nuitari
cover the walls from floor to ceiling, carved with such preciseness that
they could easily be mistaken for artwork.

    The outer wall of the tower curves wide to your east, forming a perfect
circle with the walls further north and south. An unseen force compels you
to move westward, where an archway in the obsidian wall leads to a small
laboratory. The wall to your west continues on southward, where it bisects
the pitch black outer wall of the tower. Another archway lies in this
direction as well though from here you cannot see where it opens up to, and
to the north a stairway leads back down the tower.

    Looming up to the ceiling north of here is a door of iridescent metal,
it hums with evil powers as a warning to any unwelcome guests. Frothing
potions send off noxious vapours, set up as a part of an elaborate
experiment. Along with the potions, a long steel table against the southern
wall is cluttered with dozens of glass vials, interconnected by curving
tubes and sitting above small magical flames. The outer rim of the obsidian
tower curves around on your west, abruptly meeting short walls to the north
and south that lead out to the center of the tower to the east. Dark
carvings are chiseled into the hard glassy obsidian of the walls, glowing
with silvery light and smothering this floor of the tower with an evil
presence.

a scorched table of wood circles around the room, upon which various

it hums with evil powers as a warning to any unwelcome guests. Frothing
potions send off noxious vapours, set up as a part of an elaborate

tubes and sitting above small magical flames. The outer rim of the obsidian
tower curves around on your west, abruptly meeting short walls to the north
and south that lead out to the center of the tower to the east. Dark
carvings are chiseled into the hard glassy obsidian of the walls, glowing
with silvery light and smothering this floor of the tower with an evil

    Strong magic ripples through your body here, flowing out of the walls
in invisible waves. The obsidian walls of the tower itself glow with an
eerie and unnatural light, defeating the use of having any torches here.
Your eyes tear from strong chemicals in the air, mostly flowing in from a
tall stairway to your north. Boxing you in on both sides, smooth glass-like
walls form a hallway, forcing you either to an intersection north or back
out of the tower south.

[36mThe Base of a Black Tower[0;37m
    By far the most noticeable feature of this area is a tower to the
northwest. Its rounded base protrudes into this room, with a sturdy metal
door allowing access to its obsidian walls. Rising up to and through the
ceiling, the tower almost looks ancient and must have been erected first,
with the building constructed around it. There is a strange odor in the air
here, though the distinct smell of blood wafts in from the east, there is
another peculiar one that is hard to finger and becomes increasingly strong
nearer the tower.

[36mThe End of a Hall[0;37m
    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door

dull stone. Westward a creaky wooden door leads out onto the rest of this

[36mA Dank Cellar[0;37m
    Thick cracks full of crumbling rock run through the stony walls, and
the air is heavy with wetness. The walls are carved from the earth, and
partially supported by rotting wooden beams that are wedged between the
floor and ceiling. An iron staircase creaks and strains under it's own
weight, sending shrill echoes through the cavernous cellar. Just barely
able to light the room, a few near extinguished torches flicker on the
walls. West of here the cellar intersects, heading off in two more
directions, and through the stairwell you can climb up to the first
subterranean floor of the building.

    Two halls run perpendicular through the cellar here, one due north and
the other eastward. Shedding just enough light to see is a flickering torch
on the southern wall, joined by a few that have burnt out and no longer
serve any purpose. The inherent dampness in the air is obvious here, grungy
water trickles through a narrow crack to the west and spills onto the
floor. Thriving in the moisture, little insects burrow through the rotting
wood beams along the ceiling and walls, adding to their struggle to support
the massive building overhead.

    Three choices lay before you at this intersection. Towards the north

empty save the little insects that live here, while to the east a row of
cells lines the hallway. Decaying timbers barely support the heavy ceiling
here, some of them stand only midway up the wall having collapsed under
their own weight. The cellar's air is fetid with the smell of rot and
decay, making you think twice before taking a deep breath.

    The hallway takes a turn here, crooking eastward and further south. At
the far eastern corner of the cellar you can see a staircase through the
gloomy torchlight, while directly west of you a solid wall of earth impedes
movement. Thick oak timbers stand tall along the walls, supporting the
stone ceiling, though some are becoming warped and bowed by stress. Light
is plentiful here, provided by a few newly lit torches attached to the
walls though the air is smokey and a bit smothering.

    The quarters of a lieutenant of the dragonarmy lie east of here,
entered through a thick wooden door. Spreading out in every other direction
are the grounds upon which fledgeling soldiers in the dragonarmy hone their
skills until they are powerful enough to do battle with the good forces of
Ansalon. Debris covers a good area of the floor, sheared off pieces of
armor and weapons mostly. Above your head the ceiling is spotted and dirty
with blood stains, as are the walls enclosing the facility.

    Lining the corner walls of the building are several tall metal lockers
in which soldiers keep their weapons. The training facility continues off
to the north where there's the quarters of an officer, and far to the west.
Unlike the rest of the grounds the floor here is relatively clean of
debris, probably because of the lack of space to maneuver around the bulky
lockers.

Also, to the west, grey stone walls box off a large room within the
grounds. Bits of metal and wood bounce across the room with every step,
obviously the dragonarmy isn't preoccupied with cleanliness.

are the grounds upon which fledgeling soldiers in the dragonarmy hone their
skills until they are powerful enough to do battle with the good forces of

    Dented metal lockers stand in rows against the two wooden walls here,
containing armor and weapons for the soldiers in training to practice with.
The cold stone floor is mostly free of litter here, though where the
grounds continue south and west it is covered in streaks of blood and metal
shards. Looking across the building to the southwest, near the corner you
can see the stone walls of a room within the grounds, and to the south the
grounds run far off across a field of litter.

Unlike the rest of the grounds the floor here is relatively clean of

    The medical quarters stink with the odor of gangrenous flesh, and all
around you recruits lie wounded or on their deathbeds. This is where
training mishaps are tended to, and also where medical officers teach some
trainees the basics in bandaging wounds. To the south a makeshift wall of
long wooden boards is bolted to the ceiling beam, hanging down to the floor
and running straight east to give some shelter between the training
fighters and the recuperating injured. More cots line the makeshift wall
heading east, and a flap of leather is hooked open west, where the grounds
for weapons training lie.

underneath the port side door.

over the ship seems to be better here than elsewhere. Perhaps the open

from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

    Little natural light filters down from the grate above your head. What
little light does penetrate the darkness reveals a small and rough-hewn
tunnel. The tunnel is wide enough for two men to walk abreast and only
slightly hunched over, not the most comfortable of spaces, but it could be
far worse. No matter how much light is present shadows still coat the
tunnel, hiding nooks and crannies that would be perfect for the
enterprising thief or assassin.

    Rounding a slight corner in the rough tunnel you come to a choice of
directions. The ground here is worn smooth from years of use by countless
people. The tunnel is noteably wider here, perhaps to accommodate larger
amounts of traffic. A faint light shines to your north, with darkness
blocking any view of the tunnels to your west. To the east, small lamps
flicker in the darkness.

heard coming from the east, as well as the sound of people laboring to

    Immediately you notice that the hard stone floor gives way thick wooden
planks in this section of the tunnel. Your footsteps sound loudly upon the
wooden floor, giving anyone around notice that someone has come to their
lair. The tunnel still maintains the roughly finished look that indicates
heavy usage.

[36mThe Merchant's Tunnel[0;37m
    The tunnel changes notably in this section. Small, oil lamps give off
greasy light to slightly illuminate this section of tunnel. The walls and
floors of the cavern lack the rough natural texturing of the previous
tunnels and have a more finished look to them. Footsteps and voices can be
heard coming from the east, as well as the sound of people laboring to
achieve some task.

[36mA Fork In The Tunnel[0;37m
    Rounding a slight corner in the rough tunnel you come to a choice of
directions. The ground here is worn smooth from years of use by countless
people. The tunnel is noteably wider here, perhaps to accommodate larger
amounts of traffic. A faint light shines to your north, with darkness
blocking any view of the tunnels to your west. To the east, small lamps
flicker in the darkness.

[36mAt the Edge of the Underbelly of Balifor[0;37m
    Little natural light filters down from the grate above your head. What
little light does penetrate the darkness reveals a small and rough-hewn
tunnel. The tunnel is wide enough for two men to walk abreast and only
slightly hunched over, not the most comfortable of spaces, but it could be
far worse. No matter how much light is present shadows still coat the
tunnel, hiding nooks and crannies that would be perfect for the
enterprising thief or assassin.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not

acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

may take a relaxing bath if you wish. There are plenty of trees and
thornbushes here to dry your wet clothes if that is what you wish. The path
continues to the north where the vegetation becomes denser.

able to stand on its own anymore, a few words have been written on it. A

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that you are forced to travel are grassy or covered with small
rocks. The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you
high above to the north.

the canyon during the day, and frozen solid at night. The railing is about
five feet high, protecting travellers and their beasts of burden. The land
to the north is hilly, and far off you see the great Khalkist mountain
range glaring at you, their jagged peaks spearing eagerly at the sky.
Peering below to the east, you can see the outlines of the Hedge. This
marks the boundaries of the Silvanesti Forest.

    Here at the east end of New Tarsis, a sturdy gate stands ready to seal
the city from any threat. The finest oak, imported from the northern
forests, swings on stout iron hinges. A heavy iron bar can be slotted into
notches in the walls themselves to prevent the gate's being opened. Stone
walls stretch to the north and south.

    A central paved area is surrounded by grass and trees. There are some

to take advantage of traffic coming and going from the two major stores off
the square, one to the north and one to the west.

east where a run-down tavern can be seen.  To the west, the freshly painted
facade of the Wooly Tusker Inn beckons invitingly.  Shabby houses dot the
rutted track leading north, and to the south, a larger path leading away from

about this room are the men who hold the real power in the town.  Gamblers,
thugs, bandits, and worse can be found gambling and talking at the many
tables.  All eyes turn to you as you enter, then look away quickly as their
gaze is met.  The quiet of this room stands out in sharp contrast to the loud
revelry taking place to the south.

    The Tavern of the Ice Reach is a much rougher place than it's counterpart
up the street.  Cheap ale and sawdust cover the patches of floor you can see
through the press of bodies.  Haggard looking barmaids weave through the
crowd delivering pitchers of the local brew.  You consider ordering a mug,
but reconsider as you observe the effect it has on the other patrons.   Here
and there you see shadows of men conducting business best left unheard.  To
the north, there seems to be some excitement taking place in the next room.

the north, the path winds it's way back to Zeeriak, and beyond to Tarsis.
To the south, however, the glaring whiteness of the glacier seems to stretch
infinitely.  To the southwest, a lone spire rises from the glacier, for what
purpose, you can not tell.

[36mToward the Glacier[0;37m
    As the path widens, a smaller path branches off and leads east, toward a
lightly wooded area.  The trees are the only sign of plant life you have seen
that has withstood the elements.  Tall and straight, they stand as testament
to the fact that life does exist in this barren wasteland of ice and snow.
Ever larger, the glacier lies to the south, while to the north lies a long
trek back to civilization.

    The path turns northward here, detouring around a large tree which stands
to the east.  As you look for the booted tracks you have followed so far, you
notice once again the tracks of another creature, seeming to follow the same
path you follow.  The second set of tracks is less covered by snow, indicating
they were made after the humanoid tracks were laid.  Shuddering at the thought
of predators so closeby, you once again turn a wary eye to the woods.

by nearby ocean waters that now exist hundreds of miles away.

    A long desk of polished marble runs the length of the room. Behind it,
a massive vault hangs open. Ward runes above the entry glow softly. Clerks

fluted columns support a gracefully arched ceiling and the story of the
building of New Tarsis is displayed in bas-relief stone panels on the
walls.

    The path you are standing on picks and winds its way around blackened
mounds of debris. Several piles have been used as dumpsites for the city of
Tarsis and small rats and birds scatter as you pass several. Other piles
are massive slabs of burnt bedrock and charred timbers, tossed about like
they were toys and heaped up in various places.

    The ground suddenly dips away to the west from here. To the east, piles
of debris and charred timber lead the way to the trading city of Tarsis. A
small path runs along the height of land to your north and south. To the
west, the ground is sandy and slopes gently down for miles. Pieces of white
sun-bleached shells lie scattered about and you see several spires of
rotting timber poking out of the sand to the west.

has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the

[36mHigh Street[0;37m
    You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

[36mThe Bank of Balifor[0;37m
    The bank of Balifor looks fairly rundown. Not surprising, since the
local populace doesn't earn enough money to bother putting it in banks.
Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window and
door, looks enthusiastic enough. A small sign has been stuck to the desk.

[36mTraders Square[0;37m
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. Traders
can be seen travelling down this to and from the inns of Balifor at all
times of day or night.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
