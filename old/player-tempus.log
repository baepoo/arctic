    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or

    The tunnel changes notably in this section. Small, oil lamps give off
greasy light to slightly illuminate this section of tunnel. The walls and
floors of the cavern lack the rough natural texturing of the previous
tunnels and have a more finished look to them. Footsteps and voices can be
heard coming from the east, as well as the sound of people laboring to
achieve some task.

    Immediately you notice that the hard stone floor gives way thick wooden
planks in this section of the tunnel. Your footsteps sound loudly upon the
wooden floor, giving anyone around notice that someone has come to their
lair. The tunnel still maintains the roughly finished look that indicates
heavy usage.

The ground is smooth here, indicating a relatively large amount of traffic.

home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window and

    This area of the ship is dominated by the helm, which looks to have
been recently occupied. The stern of the ship is immaculate, which strikes
you as out-of-place among the pervasive stench of decay. On a table near
the helm, you take notice of a navigation chart and various tools used for
finding one's way at sea.

    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

small shop is to the north with a large wooden sign hanging just above the
entryway. A stand full of fresh fish can be seen to the south.

    A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disgarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The grass around you is long and yellowed, making you wonder what the
land would look like if it rained more often. Looking at the dirt road you
walk on, you decide a firm road is desired more than the alternative of a
muddy track. Humming softly, you continue on your journey. The path leads
north and west.

    Looking around, you are amazed to see...more grass. The terrain is
constant, with little change that you can see. If there is any life in
these plains, you've seen no sign of it. You idly pluck a nearby strand of
grass, rolling it between your fingers. A light wind swirls in the air, and
you continue on. The road runs north and south.

    You have reached a crossroads of sorts. A small path leads off to the

appears to be a crude settlement. Smoke rises in the air and the smell of
food makes your stomach rumble. Somewhere to the south lies the port town
of Balifor.

blows in from the south, most likely from the Southern Courrain Ocean.
However, it offers no relief - just more stale, dry air.

     You are now nearing what seems to be the center of the Brog camp. You
can spot little broglings scuttling about with their parents frequently
here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other
hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard, cold
stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various huts
and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a

leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a

curiosity, you crane your neck to catch a glimpse of what sort of
contraband might be dealt with here. To your dismay, you only see the
desperate hands of several Brog bartering for a simple loaf of bread, a
healthy cactus, or the like. The people here are desperate, finding a means
to an end in dirty places.

     You are now in a bit more remote part of the settlement, apart from
most of the other huts. Despite this fact, the path here seems worn and
well used. To the north lies a dirty hut. Its dome is blackened and
unmaintained, with hairline cracks all along its surface. Trash is
littered about the area, and you can see a few spots where an individual
or two decided to let it all go.

Animal carcasses, random chunks of metal, and strips of cloth are all on

that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of survival.
In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a
couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

curiosity, you crane your neck to catch a glimpse of what sort of
contraband might be dealt with here. To your dismay, you only see the
desperate hands of several Brog bartering for a simple loaf of bread, a
healthy cactus, or the like. The people here are desperate, finding a means

here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other

and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

     Sloping dunes of sand sweep around you, completely dominating the
scenery. Not much can be seen here, but every once in a while you notice
thin, spidery pockets of sand drawn up towards the sky in the buffeting
winds. Here you can almost smell somthing different in the air, perhaps
bordering between freshly killed food, and the old stench of death.

[36mPath Through the Woods[0;37m
     As you near the collection of taller trees, your mind again begins to
wonder about the silence around you. The trees here are nondescript, each
resembling the trees in Solace Park or around Balifor. The path is rocky,
but it isn't impossible to travel on. In the distance you can barely make
out the  sound of a stream feeding into a body of water. What could have
caused the quietness remains foremost in your mind as you approach the dark
trees. Glancing to the west you realize there is plenty of time to leave
this mystery unsolved and return to someplace safer.

[36mCurve in the Path[0;37m
     The path again curves here, but the bend looks far more natural here
than it did earlier. Glancing above the tree tops, your mouth drops open in
awe and surprise as you see how close you are to the collection of darker
trees. Turning your head to the path behind you, it looks far longer than
you would have expected. With a shrug you return your attention to the path
ahead of you and the collection of dark trees. You sense that whatever it
is that caused the silence here resides in those trees, and you are getting
closer to it with every step.

[36mNear the Crytic Forest[0;37m
     The path you're on begins to smooth out here, though you can't see any
reason why it should. There are no tracks indicating travelers or animals
through this area, and no sounds of life in the air. A deep fear begins to
grow in your bones as your mind visualizes various creatures or entities
that could frighten all the life away from an area. To the south the path
becomes rougher, but there isn't a sense of dread in that direction. To the
east the path become smoother and darker still as you see the edge of what
looks to be a vast forest.

[36mPath to Crytic Forest[0;37m
     Before you stands the entrance to the Crytic Forest, once beheld as a
universal source of peace and tranquility. Some of that past glory is still
evident in the trees nearest the entrance, but as you peer further in it is
quickly apparent that doesn't hold true throughout the forest. It were as
if the forest just gave up and died. The evil in the air hangs heavily
around you, seeming to drip from the leaves onto your shoulder. Nearby
the path, to your right, is the head of an unlucky traveler mounted on a
steel pike. The flies buzzing around its swollen eyes take little interest
in you or your quest, their only concern being the fresh blood of the
recently deceased. Below the head is a sign.

     Even though you are still close to the forest's edge, you sense you
are not alone. Something inhuman screams from a distance, the sound echoing
through the forest until you can't distinguish which direction it came
from. A small sign hangs here.

     The ground here seems stranger than most areas of the forest. It is
soaked with some kind of liquid, though you can't believe that rain falls
too often on the forest floor due to the overbearing canopy of trees. A
sound is heard in the nearby distance, something almost animal, but then
quickly muffled. With a heavy heart, your choices are to continue into the
forest where you feel you will be watched or escape Crytic now by turning
back.

     You see a break in the path to the east. It is too dark to see in that
direction due to the canopy overhead, but the dampness of the ground is
greater here than before. You kneel down to study the ground and realize
for certain that it was not water that soaked the ground but rather blood.
Slowly raising your eyes to the trees around you, you sense they are
watching your movements in an attempt to know when to attack. It even seems
as though they live off the blood in the ground, preferring it to water.

     The ground here is softer to the west, but it quickly hardens as you
move to the east. Despite the hope the firmer ground gives to you, there is
a foreboding to the east that you cannot shake. The trees seem to be even
darker in that direction, almost thirsting for blood though you know that
can't be possible. The only clear exits are west to the softer ground or
east into the darkened forest.

nothing, only the breeze blowing through the trees. It doesn't occur to you

     As you enter this section of the path, you are immediately struck by
the deep grooves in the ground and the multiple tracks of creatures that
have passed this way. You even see a pair that resemble someone or
something being dragged through the mud, most likely against their will. To
the north you see signs of a small skirmish while to the south and west
lies more of the forest. You also notice the tracks continue to the south,
but you are unsure how far.

A griffon flies in from the west.
[36mNear the Crossroads[0;37m
     The smell is most prevalent here, probably because it is coming
directly from the north. Smoke wafts toward you from the north as well,
carrying the sickening smell toward you. You're only options are toward the
smell, despite what your stomach may think, or to the west away from the
smell. Another rustle of leaves distracts you momentarily from the smell,
but a fresh breeze from the north returns your attention to it.

A griffon flies in from the south.
[36mThe Crossroads[0;37m
     You've come upon the source of the smoke you saw on the horizon. A
large bonfire lies in the middle of this crossroads in the woods, but the
fuel is anything but the trees. The smell from the fire immediately tells
you that the animals of the forest and any victims that weren't immediately
killed were brought here to be burned to death. You cover your nose and
mouth to avoid inhaling too much of the foul stench, praying that you won't
be one of the victims thrown on the fire next. To accommodate the
rising fire, smoke and smell, the canopy overhead has been opened somehow,
allowing you to see the sky.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    The trading section of the blacksmithy is a little cleaner than the
rest of the building, but not much. The heat from the furnace sweeps over
you and warms your chilled body. On the walls are multitudes of iron racks,
encompassing all the armor and weapons you are ever likely to need.
Unfortunately, some of the better ones are in cabinets with 'Not for sale'
signs on them. Still, there are some very good offers around.

around the rest of the docks. As you look down the pier to the west, you
catch a glimpse of a huge old sailing ship, which has absolutely no traffic
going to and from it.

serves as a testament to this fact. You are thankful for the presence of

[36mThe Road To Port Balifor[0;37m
    This long and dusty road leads south to the port of Balifor, a busy
trading centre for Krynn. All travellers are welcome in Port Balifor but
one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that
call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and
expansive slums, Balifor is not home for the meek.

travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north

the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies down a

near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from

is plenty of light by which to travel. The path leads through the woods to
the other side in a north direction. There are no trails and no animal
tracks in any other direction. To the north you leave the woods and the
trail continues into the foothills.

[36mThe Waiting Room[0;37m
    You are standing in an elaborate waiting room, anticipating waiting for
something. A large desk sits against one wall, nothing at all is on the
desk. A sofa made of soft leather sits near the desk, probably used to take
a rest from all the waiting. A small sign post leans against the desk, not
able to stand on its own anymore, a few words have been written on it. A
few chairs line the wall opposite the desk, looking as if they have never
been touched. Despite the large open areas in the room, it is quite
comfortable. The only obvious exit is down.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the

the bank of Balifor.

your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

     You are in the fields outside the illustrious city of Palanthas, the
jewel of Solamnia. You have a great view of the city from here, Palanthas
is a huge city of trade and diverse cultures. The citizens of Palanthas are
so confident that they are in no danger of an invasion, they don't even
have a real city wall around the city. To the citizens, it detracts from
the beauty of the city, and a truly beautiful city it is.

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The forest to the east suddenly thins out as it nears the village, the
trees are much more scattered now. You can see many huts and small homes
set up along this road that leads through the village to the west. You
notice that the further west you move, the more hills you encounter, you
must be near a mountain range.

stretch out in every direction. To the east they eventually reach the

that glide by slowly seem to be influenced. You can't help but wonder what
