[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of

one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

Looking across the water to the north and the west, you occasionally catch
a glimpse of a marlin leaping out of the clear blue water. Many ships dot
the horizon and you hesitate to try to count them.

sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and

stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    This path skirts the hills of Khuri-Khan, a large system of dry, grassy
foothills. The hills gradually become steeper to the north while, to the
south, the land flattens out somewhat. The road is made of mulch and looks
relatively well travelled as there are many wagon ruts and footprints from
travelers who have come before you.

    A cool breeze blows in from the east where you can see the Khurman Sea
a ways off. The road becomes much larger here and to the north while to the
southeast it almost becomes buried in tall grasses. To the northwest you
can see the hills of Khuri Khan. The road skirts the sides of these rolling
hills which eventually merge with the lower, warmer hills of the Ek-Khan.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the
waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

through the thick layer of ash that covers the road, and all of the trees

[36mOn a Cool Road[0;37m
    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the
waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

while a small set of wooden steps leads to the door of the wagon. The peaks
of the tents can still be made out a ways to the north west.

[36mNearing a Rocky Island[0;37m
     Ominous dark waters churn all around you, making a loud roaring noise.
A few sickly-yellow clumps of kelp have floated to the surface of the
water, and are now subject to the thrashing of the waves. Seagulls and
other birds fly overhead, occasionally swooping down to pick up their food.
Looking westward, you see some jagged cliffs rising up from the beachhead
of the island. Once known to be uninhabited, it is now rumoured that
pirates have taken over the island and made it their base of operations. If
it were indeed inhabited by pirates, it would prove to be a profitable
adventure. Legends about the wealth of the pirates in the blood sea area
are known all over Krynn.

away from civilization. The water here is calm, and fish can be seen
darting beneath the blood-red tinted waters. To the west lies a small
natural bay. Eastward lies more of the waters of the Blood Sea, named after
the myth that the sea is red with the blood of the innocents who died
during the Cataclysm.

[36mEdge of a Treacherous Cliff[0;37m
     You are atop a dangerous and quite treacherous looking cliff. The
beach is some three to four hundred feet below you, and since you don't
feel like pursuing a career as hamburger meat, you tend to stay away from
the edge. All around your northern and eastern sides is a plateau top, with
a path running around the perimeter. Off in the distance, you are able to
see a massive lighthouse that looks like it has been standing since before
the Cataclysm. Rumors of pirates abound in these areas, so you stay on your
guard as you walk along.

[36mPath Along the Sea Cliff[0;37m
     This lazy path runs all around the perimeter of the sea cliff, giving
you a perfect bird's eye view of what is happening far below you, which
appears to be little at the moment. The view from this standpoint is
breathtaking and quite picturesque, worthy of any artist's brush. Looking
to the north, you see a massive light house jutting up from the middle of
the plateau area, still operated to guide the pirates into shore safely.
Short grasses and patches of flowers grow on the ground around here and
alongside the path itself. Looking down upon the path, you see hundreds of
hoofprints, more than likely from sentries patrolling the lighthouse.

     You are walking along the lazy path that runs along the sea cliff
perimeter. From your point of vantage, you can clearly see the beachhead,
although there is nothing really to be seen there at the moment. Looking
north, you are able to see a massive lighthouse jutting up from the flat
surface of the plateau. Though believed to be unused for many years, it is
now the belief of many a drunken sailor that it is indeed run by pirates,
in order to guide their ships in. Grasses, short flowers, and very little
else are commonplace along the surface of the plateau itself, however. You
also notice rather large hoofprints on the surface of the path, and many of
them at that.

way to tall, thick yellow grasses. The grasses blow gently in the breeze,
looking almost like waves. A few birds chirp and fly around overhead,
scanning the area for possible food and shelter.

     You are less than five hundred paces from the lighthouse. From this
distance, you are able to clearly see just how big the lighthouse is, and
moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

A griffon flies in from the east.
[36mBefore the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand immediately before an ancient lighthouse, made of rough-hewn
stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

     You are less than five hundred paces from the lighthouse. From this

moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in

[36mBefore the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand immediately before an ancient lighthouse, made of rough-hewn
stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

south to the lighthouse and east to yet another cliff. Seagulls circle
lazily above you, their cries of hunger piercing the crimson sky. It
appears as if someone has taken great pains to hide this path and whatever
it may lead to, for reasons you aren't quite sure of.

     The faint path that you were once following takes a turn to the south,
where it leads into a small cove. Towards your east lies a rocky cliff, not
very high, but still high enough to pose a little bit of a problem.
Seagulls and other birds fly by, squawking at you for intruding upon their
domain. The sky is given a remarkable crimson hue due to light reflecting
off of the blood-red seawater. The beach, however, is rocky enough to
prevent your movement into the sea itself.

     You are inside a secluded cove which appears to have been made into a
home of some sort. Various fineries are in place throughout the interior of
the cove, proof positive that whomever lives here is wealthy indeed.
However, a rack of weapons against the western wall shows that several of
the weapons in place there are still wet with blood. A sturdy cot lies
against the northern wall, within reaching distance of the weapons rack.
Everything appears to be in some sort of order, which you have a feeling
that you shouldn't attempt to disturb.

     The faint path that you were once following takes a turn to the south,
where it leads into a small cove. Towards your east lies a rocky cliff, not
very high, but still high enough to pose a little bit of a problem.
Seagulls and other birds fly by, squawking at you for intruding upon their
domain. The sky is given a remarkable crimson hue due to light reflecting
off of the blood-red seawater. The beach, however, is rocky enough to
prevent your movement into the sea itself.

lazily above you, their cries of hunger piercing the crimson sky. It
appears as if someone has taken great pains to hide this path and whatever
it may lead to, for reasons you aren't quite sure of.

[36mNearing the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You are less than five hundred paces from the lighthouse. From this
distance, you are able to clearly see just how big the lighthouse is, and
moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

[36mBefore the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand immediately before an ancient lighthouse, made of rough-hewn
stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

[36mSaifhum Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand just inside the believed-to-be abandoned lighthouse of the
island. The room is barely illuminated by flickering candlelight, and you
are unable to see into the depths of the lighthouse. A set of very sturdy
looking stone stairs leads above, running like a corkscrew around the
inside perimeter of the lighthouse. The warped oakenwood floor is obviously
in a state of disrepair, with wood bowing up from the floor every few feet.
A few pieces have been noticably cut to form a small outline on the floor,
with a small lock atop it. To the north lie the oak doors that once barred
your entrance into this very lighthouse. Looking upwards, all that you are
able to see is more stairs, more shadow, and more lighthouse...

     Sturdy copper sconces line the walls of the room, providing faint
illumination, also giving the room an eery feel from the flickering
candlelight. You feel air rush into the lighthouse from a gaping hole to
the east, chilling your bones. Looking below from the hole, you discover
that the short way out of the lighthouse would definitely not be conducive
to a long life span. Solid looking stairs travel along the side of the
lighthouse, running up and down in a corkscrew pattern.

     You are standing just inside a brightly coloured green and red tent.
The rough canvas material forming the shell of the tent flaps noisily
against the supports, making a rather annoying thwapping sound. Several

The rough canvas material forming the shell of the tent flaps noisily
against the supports, making a rather annoying thwapping sound. Several
wooden beams, acting as supports, rise up from the ground and form an arch
at the top to hold up the tent. A hole is at the very top of the tent to
let smoke from the firepit escape, and there also appears to be a stone
firepit in the middle of the tent. The grass on the ground here is barren,

     The canvas shell of the tent beats noisily against the supports,
fueled by the always present coastal winds. To the north, you are able to
make out a very faint outline of a flap, tied together by a single hemp
cord. A few hastily constructed and overall shoddy looking wooden benches
are here, lining the perimeter of the tent. Your lungs feel as if they are
about to explode from all of the dust that you have breathed in, and you
can't wait to get out of here.

     You are surrounded by tall, swaying grasses and rolling foothills. The
wind rhythmically makes the grasses sway back and forth, almost putting you
into a trance. However, the mood is perversed by knowing that something
just isn't right. You aren't able to deduce what makes you aware of this,
but the fact of the matter is, something's wrong.

[36mStanding Before a Large Tent[0;37m
     A large, olive colored tent rises to your north. The tent is made of a
thick canvas material, and it makes a loud thwapping noise as the wind
catches it. A medium sized dirt path leads directly north into the tent, or
south between two smaller tents. Grasses surround the road on either side,
swaying rythmically in the wind. A few clumps of trodden flowers lie along
the side of the road also, mashed by huge hooved feet. A few birds fly
around in a circular fashion, looking for a few tasty morsels.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the

one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that
call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and

    Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.

    This road follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. A glittering expanse of
blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that
sways the few trees that manage to grow along this road. To the north you
see a crossroads, while south of here the road follows the sea to Port
Balifor.

    The coast of the Khurman Sea is just south of this well-travelled road.
The road slowly bends, wide enough so that many wagons can pass by each
other. The sounds of waves crashing and gulls crying drifts in on a dry
breeze from the southwest, and the air is filled with the saline smell of
saltwater. The occasional fisherman drifts idly by, and the sea is usually
peaceful.

    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

[36mRoad Through the Camp[0;37m
    Winding its way through the jumbled and twisting tents, this road seems
to be the proper path through all the chaos. Shouts from the merchants can
be heard ringing out over the tops of the tents. Travellers pass by you on
their way through the caravan. Some stop to buy the wares of the merchants,
others pull their cloaks over their heads and walk along oblivious to the
shouting.

    Leaving the dusty road behind you, you step into the midst of a large

their wares to the travellers wandering by. Some approach you and show you
their selection. To the south, the main portion of the caravan opens out
before you.

and swoops around small mounds and large boulders. The forest on either

    You are standing on the crest of the highest of hills around you. The
forest drapes the hills like a big fluffy green carpet. The wind is stiff
here, keeping you cool and blowing away any mosquitos that might have been
following you. To the east, you can see the vast expanse of the open ocean
which glimmers like a silver blanket. The ocean extends into the Blood Sea
of Istar as you follow it northward. The road here maintains its elevation
as it leads northward and also descends sharply down the hill to the south.

[36mEdge of a Treacherous Cliff[0;37m
     You are atop a dangerous and quite treacherous looking cliff. The
beach is some three to four hundred feet below you, and since you don't
feel like pursuing a career as hamburger meat, you tend to stay away from
the edge. All around your northern and eastern sides is a plateau top, with
a path running around the perimeter. Off in the distance, you are able to
see a massive lighthouse that looks like it has been standing since before
the Cataclysm. Rumors of pirates abound in these areas, so you stay on your
guard as you walk along.

     This lazy path runs all around the perimeter of the sea cliff, giving
you a perfect bird's eye view of what is happening far below you, which
appears to be little at the moment. The view from this standpoint is
breathtaking and quite picturesque, worthy of any artist's brush. Looking
to the north, you see a massive light house jutting up from the middle of
the plateau area, still operated to guide the pirates into shore safely.
Short grasses and patches of flowers grow on the ground around here and
alongside the path itself. Looking down upon the path, you see hundreds of
hoofprints, more than likely from sentries patrolling the lighthouse.

north, you are able to see a massive lighthouse jutting up from the flat

in order to guide their ships in. Grasses, short flowers, and very little
else are commonplace along the surface of the plateau itself, however. You
also notice rather large hoofprints on the surface of the path, and many of
them at that.

moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

[36mBefore the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand immediately before an ancient lighthouse, made of rough-hewn
stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

     You stand just inside the believed-to-be abandoned lighthouse of the
island. The room is barely illuminated by flickering candlelight, and you
are unable to see into the depths of the lighthouse. A set of very sturdy
looking stone stairs leads above, running like a corkscrew around the
inside perimeter of the lighthouse. The warped oakenwood floor is obviously
in a state of disrepair, with wood bowing up from the floor every few feet.
A few pieces have been noticably cut to form a small outline on the floor,
with a small lock atop it. To the north lie the oak doors that once barred
your entrance into this very lighthouse. Looking upwards, all that you are
able to see is more stairs, more shadow, and more lighthouse...

line the room from wall to wall, enveloping you in sticky strands of
webbing. Something that appears to be a spider's nest lies on the southern
end of the room, with a few sickly looking shells of what once must have
been humanoid figures. A few piles of crates lie broken and scattered
throughout the room, and it appears likely that the spider that inhabits
this room's prey put up a fight. A huge, gaping hole lies in the basement,
with a tunnel leading out of it to the north.

at the top to hold up the tent. A hole is at the very top of the tent to
let smoke from the firepit escape, and there also appears to be a stone
firepit in the middle of the tent. The grass on the ground here is barren,
and only a few scrubby yellow patches are here and there.

     A large, olive colored tent rises to your north. The tent is made of a
thick canvas material, and it makes a loud thwapping noise as the wind
catches it. A medium sized dirt path leads directly north into the tent, or
south between two smaller tents. Grasses surround the road on either side,
swaying rythmically in the wind. A few clumps of trodden flowers lie along
the side of the road also, mashed by huge hooved feet. A few birds fly
around in a circular fashion, looking for a few tasty morsels.

[36mInside the Pirate's Tent[0;37m
     You stand just inside a large, pyramid shaped tent. The tent is made
out of a rough, drab olive canvas material that is quite coarse and grainy
to the touch. This tent is much larger than the ones you have encountered
previously on this item, as it is the personal quarters of the pirate
captain. To the south you spy a large flap, the same one that you passed
through to enter this tent.

[36mInside the Pirate's Tent[0;37m
     You are still inside the pirate captain's personal tent. Quite
utilitarian and spartan in nature, there are absolutely no decorations on
the inside of this tent. The ground is completely covered with cloven hoof
prints, and occasionally dust flies up from the ground and congeals in your
lungs. A few patches of grass are here and there, attempting to grow but
unable to due to the lack of sunlight and sufficient water.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is

blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that

crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder

    The road makes a bend here, heading south along the Khalkists and east
towards the coast. Looking towards the east you can make out white caps on
the sea and hear the sound of the water as it meets the shore. Towards
the south the road travels parallel to the Khalkhist mountains, avoiding
most of the large peaks as it heads away from the coast.

     Ominous dark waters churn all around you, making a loud roaring noise.
A few sickly-yellow clumps of kelp have floated to the surface of the
water, and are now subject to the thrashing of the waves. Seagulls and
other birds fly overhead, occasionally swooping down to pick up their food.
Looking westward, you see some jagged cliffs rising up from the beachhead
of the island. Once known to be uninhabited, it is now rumoured that
pirates have taken over the island and made it their base of operations. If
it were indeed inhabited by pirates, it would prove to be a profitable
adventure. Legends about the wealth of the pirates in the blood sea area
are known all over Krynn.

away from civilization. The water here is calm, and fish can be seen
darting beneath the blood-red tinted waters. To the west lies a small
natural bay. Eastward lies more of the waters of the Blood Sea, named after
the myth that the sea is red with the blood of the innocents who died
during the Cataclysm.

feet into the air. The cliff's face, however, is oddly smooth, and
handholds appear to be few and far between. To your east lies the churning

handholds few and quite far between. Far below you lies the sandy crimson
beach of the believed-to-be uninhabited island. A hundred yards or so above
your current position is the cliff top, and with a little luck, ingenuity,
and perseverance, you should make it there.

     You are atop a dangerous and quite treacherous looking cliff. The
beach is some three to four hundred feet below you, and since you don't
feel like pursuing a career as hamburger meat, you tend to stay away from
the edge. All around your northern and eastern sides is a plateau top, with
a path running around the perimeter. Off in the distance, you are able to
see a massive lighthouse that looks like it has been standing since before
the Cataclysm. Rumors of pirates abound in these areas, so you stay on your
guard as you walk along.

you a perfect bird's eye view of what is happening far below you, which
appears to be little at the moment. The view from this standpoint is
breathtaking and quite picturesque, worthy of any artist's brush. Looking
to the north, you see a massive light house jutting up from the middle of
the plateau area, still operated to guide the pirates into shore safely.
Short grasses and patches of flowers grow on the ground around here and
alongside the path itself. Looking down upon the path, you see hundreds of
hoofprints, more than likely from sentries patrolling the lighthouse.

heads straight into the plateau. Once sparsely vegetated terrain now gives
way to tall, thick yellow grasses. The grasses blow gently in the breeze,
looking almost like waves. A few birds chirp and fly around overhead,
scanning the area for possible food and shelter.

[36mNearing the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You are less than five hundred paces from the lighthouse. From this
distance, you are able to clearly see just how big the lighthouse is, and
moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

[36mBefore the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand immediately before an ancient lighthouse, made of rough-hewn
stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

[36mSaifhum Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand just inside the believed-to-be abandoned lighthouse of the
island. The room is barely illuminated by flickering candlelight, and you
are unable to see into the depths of the lighthouse. A set of very sturdy
looking stone stairs leads above, running like a corkscrew around the
inside perimeter of the lighthouse. The warped oakenwood floor is obviously
in a state of disrepair, with wood bowing up from the floor every few feet.
A few pieces have been noticably cut to form a small outline on the floor,
with a small lock atop it. To the north lie the oak doors that once barred
your entrance into this very lighthouse. Looking upwards, all that you are
able to see is more stairs, more shadow, and more lighthouse...

[36mBasement[0;37m
     You are inside the rickety basement of the lighthouse. Huge cobwebs
line the room from wall to wall, enveloping you in sticky strands of
webbing. Something that appears to be a spider's nest lies on the southern
end of the room, with a few sickly looking shells of what once must have
been humanoid figures. A few piles of crates lie broken and scattered
throughout the room, and it appears likely that the spider that inhabits
this room's prey put up a fight. A huge, gaping hole lies in the basement,
with a tunnel leading out of it to the north.

continues onward from the mouth of the tunnel towards a large and brightly

bright green and red. Two dual flaps on the eastern end of the tent sway
gently in the wind, tied together with a single rope. The wind bounces off
the surface of the tent, making a thwapping noise.

The rough canvas material forming the shell of the tent flaps noisily
against the supports, making a rather annoying thwapping sound. Several
wooden beams, acting as supports, rise up from the ground and form an arch
at the top to hold up the tent. A hole is at the very top of the tent to
let smoke from the firepit escape, and there also appears to be a stone
firepit in the middle of the tent. The grass on the ground here is barren,
and only a few scrubby yellow patches are here and there.

     You stand just inside a large, pyramid shaped tent. The tent is made
out of a rough, drab olive canvas material that is quite coarse and grainy
to the touch. This tent is much larger than the ones you have encountered
previously on this item, as it is the personal quarters of the pirate
captain. To the south you spy a large flap, the same one that you passed
through to enter this tent.

     You stand in the very center of the large pirate's tent. A giant hole
in the top of the tent lies directly above you, in order to let out smoke
and soot from the firepit. A huge firepit lies in the center, with a few
grills and spits spanning it. The dusty ground expands all around you, save
for a few places where throw rugs have been put, padded with blankets, for
the occupants to sleep upon.

[36mInside the Pirate's Tent[0;37m
     You are still inside the pirate captain's personal tent. Quite
utilitarian and spartan in nature, there are absolutely no decorations on
the inside of this tent. The ground is completely covered with cloven hoof
prints, and occasionally dust flies up from the ground and congeals in your
lungs. A few patches of grass are here and there, attempting to grow but
unable to due to the lack of sunlight and sufficient water.

out of a rough, drab olive canvas material that is quite coarse and grainy

previously on this item, as it is the personal quarters of the pirate
captain. To the south you spy a large flap, the same one that you passed

     A large, olive colored tent rises to your north. The tent is made of a
thick canvas material, and it makes a loud thwapping noise as the wind
catches it. A medium sized dirt path leads directly north into the tent, or
south between two smaller tents. Grasses surround the road on either side,
swaying rythmically in the wind. A few clumps of trodden flowers lie along
the side of the road also, mashed by huge hooved feet. A few birds fly
around in a circular fashion, looking for a few tasty morsels.

     The canvas shell of the tent beats noisily against the supports,
fueled by the always present coastal winds. To the north, you are able to
make out a very faint outline of a flap, tied together by a single hemp
cord. A few hastily constructed and overall shoddy looking wooden benches
are here, lining the perimeter of the tent. Your lungs feel as if they are
about to explode from all of the dust that you have breathed in, and you
can't wait to get out of here.

     The cloth shell of the tent flaps noisily in the wind, making an ever

form an arch at the top, making the skeleton frame of the tent. There is a
large hole at the top of the tent, in order to let smoke out when the
firepit is in use. Looking closer on the inside of the tent, you see soot
stains, caused by fire in the firepit. It appears that the tent is still in
use, and the owner probably isn't too thrilled about your intrusion. The
sparse grass here is sickly and decayed, due to lack of sunlight. Dust
particles float into the air as you walk, stirred up by your boots.

been humanoid figures. A few piles of crates lie broken and scattered

are unable to see into the depths of the lighthouse. A set of very sturdy
looking stone stairs leads above, running like a corkscrew around the
inside perimeter of the lighthouse. The warped oakenwood floor is obviously
in a state of disrepair, with wood bowing up from the floor every few feet.
A few pieces have been noticably cut to form a small outline on the floor,
with a small lock atop it. To the north lie the oak doors that once barred
your entrance into this very lighthouse. Looking upwards, all that you are

feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

[36mShallow Waters[0;37m
     Much as you would expect, very few fishermen frequent these waters,
and those that do must be quite desperate to risk life and limb this far
away from civilization. The water here is calm, and fish can be seen
darting beneath the blood-red tinted waters. To the west lies a small
natural bay. Eastward lies more of the waters of the Blood Sea, named after
the myth that the sea is red with the blood of the innocents who died
during the Cataclysm.

[36mNearing a Rocky Island[0;37m
     Ominous dark waters churn all around you, making a loud roaring noise.
A few sickly-yellow clumps of kelp have floated to the surface of the
water, and are now subject to the thrashing of the waves. Seagulls and
other birds fly overhead, occasionally swooping down to pick up their food.
Looking westward, you see some jagged cliffs rising up from the beachhead
of the island. Once known to be uninhabited, it is now rumoured that
pirates have taken over the island and made it their base of operations. If
it were indeed inhabited by pirates, it would prove to be a profitable
adventure. Legends about the wealth of the pirates in the blood sea area
are known all over Krynn.

back into existance. Travelling on a direct course to them seems to be the
only way to keep them within view, otherwise they seem to fade away,
perhaps forever.

to be the proper path through all the chaos. Shouts from the merchants can
be heard ringing out over the tops of the tents. Travellers pass by you on
their way through the caravan. Some stop to buy the wares of the merchants,
others pull their cloaks over their heads and walk along oblivious to the
shouting.

    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are

the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

    A cool breeze blows in from the east where you can see the Khurman Sea
a ways off. The road becomes much larger here and to the north while to the
southeast it almost becomes buried in tall grasses. To the northwest you
can see the hills of Khuri Khan. The road skirts the sides of these rolling
hills which eventually merge with the lower, warmer hills of the Ek-Khan.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the
waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

[36mAn Isolated Path[0;37m
     The soothing chirps of birds and the clatter of chipmunks greets you
as you enter the dense forest, far north of Balifor, nestled in the Loft
Hills Valley. Off into the distance, small woodland creatures playfully
leap from tree to tree, not paying you any attention. A small intermittent
stream twists and turns through the bottom of the small valley, beckoning
you onward. Also, a few bizarre looking birds fly overhead, occasionally
breaking the dense forest canopy. To the north the path continues, leading
you out of the forest, and back into the rest of the world.

     The familiar clatter and chirps of the wildlife fade as you travel
further down the faded path. The stream, before intermittent, now travels
directly north-south, staying above ground and widening. Small fish swim to
the surface, jabbing at the occasional dragonfly or tick. The trees grow
much larger here, with carvings in them, denoting presence of something
unbeknownst to you. The path, once fairly visible, now fades off and
becomes almost unnoticable to the unaided eye.

    The path suddenly stops, and two large trees bar your way south. The
forest grows considerably thicker here compared to the rest of the forest,
almost as if forming city walls. The trees also appear to be carefully
molded and shaped by a force much more intelligent and much less chaotic
than nature. Unable to see anything past the trees blocking your path
southward, humility washes over you. Whomever made it probably didn't want
to be disturbed.

Hills could hide a village of this magnitude. Undoubtedly hundreds live
here within plain sight, and you wonder how a village of this size has been

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the

    This gate is more of a door, a very plain door actually. Certainly, an
odd contrast to the flowing rainbow pattern of the surrounding wall. The
door is made from oak, it has a small hole at about eye level, a small
brass box attached to the door, and a simple lock. Looking down, you see a
mat with the word, 'Welcome' inscribed upon it. Flanking the door are two
small potted plants.

[36mBy the Sandstone Cliffs[0;37m
     The waters here are dark, lying in the shadow of a huge sandstone
cliff blotting out the light. The waves beat against the shoreline causing
froths of whitecaps which produce the only sound here. Tall, impassible
cliffs lie to the north and east and you think it best to avoid them as
being caught amongst the rocks would surely mean your death. The waters of
the bay around you are much more inviting.

[36mOn Balifor Bay[0;37m
     As the waters below you begin to deepen, a deep blue color is
revealed. Far away from the shoreline, the waters are calm, almost looking
like glass beneath you. A strong breeze blows across the waters, causing
you to daydream about easier times. A sudden cry from a passing seagull
brings you back to your senses and you steel yourself for the journey
ahead.

[36mThe Mouth of Balifor Bay[0;37m
     The sea opens wide before you as make your exit from the comparatively
calm water of Balifor Bay. Seagulls fly overhead gently fluttering against
the strong sea breezes; time is of no concern to these creatures. Catching
sight of a fish, a gull swoops down spearing dinner in a quick jab before
returning to the skies above.

    A monumental cliff, in the western part of the isle, ascends to great
heights where it forms a great stone arch. The steep cliff side is full of
cracks, eroded by merciless weather. As you let your eyes wander among
cracks you notice that one of the cracks appears to be enlarged. The crack
looks now more like a cave, and a very big one indeed.

    Your feet sink into the deep and warm sand as you walk along the sandy
beach. The atmosphere is very calm and reassuring. Waves broke lazily onto
the shore. At the west end of the beach there raises a cliff which seem to
be impassable. The mountainside which resides far at the eastern part of
the beach is less steep but filled with treacherous, loose rocks.
Apparently there has been many landslides from the eastern mountain, since
the beach and the water is filled with rocks of many different sizes. The
forest straight to the north and to the northeast is dark where appears to
be no movement but some strange shadows. The forest is also very thick and
filled with torn bushes. Some way from the waterline there are some quite
large sand dunes.

[36mA Sand Beach[0;37m
    In every step your foot leaves a deep depression into the sand of the
beach. Because of that the walking is rather tiresome but luckily the beach
is so small that everyone can walk from one end to another without much
difficulties. Eventually the beach ends to the mountain side full of loose
and dangerous rocks. There are lot of rocks in the water as well as in the
forest. The rocks in the forest are covered with ages old moss and vines.
Some of the rocks are small enough so that you could move them, but no way
you could clear the beach nor the mountain side from all the rocks which
prevents you from climbing up to the mountain. The forest is full of
strange shadows that gives you creeps.

    The gates of the black tower are, surprisingly, black. A paved walkway
leads to two large metal doors. There is some odd symbols carved onto the
doors. A stone figure of a two headed dragon is attached above the iron
gates. The tower has no windows. You have a strange feeling the statue of
the dragon is staring at you. The walkway which leads to the gates is

opposite wall there is a gold framed mirror and below the mirror a table,
decorated with gold and silver, leans against the eastern wall. Thick and
soft rugs covers the whole floor. The room is lit by a set of candles which
hangs from the ceiling on a golden chain. This room is vastly different
that any other room you have seen so far in this blackened tower. The other

    This room is full of luxuries. A large, ebony bed is set against the
western wall. Near the bed there stands a small night table. On the
opposite wall there is a gold framed mirror and below the mirror a table,
decorated with gold and silver, leans against the eastern wall. Thick and
soft rugs covers the whole floor. The room is lit by a set of candles which
hangs from the ceiling on a golden chain. This room is vastly different
that any other room you have seen so far in this blackened tower. The other
rooms have been odd and depressive, but this room is almost a cozy place.

    Shadows in this room are twisting around your feet. As you continue to
look at them they seem to retreat and you feel more confident. This room
has many shelves on every wall and a large stone table in the middle. On
one of the shelves are many skulls of various types, while other shelves
contain a multi- tube of herbs and a few bottles and many other types of
jars. A stain of blood is faintly visible on the stone table. A small shaft
to the north seems to be very well used. Your eyes are drawn to the
northeastern corner of the room, it seems to be in a wrong place. Hmm. You
shake your head and see that it's as it should be.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    Dock Road runs north and south here. It is bounded to the west by the
ever growing docks of Port Balifor, temporary home to a large number of
Krynn's finest trading vessels. To the east you see the bustling city of
Port Balifor. Its tall buildings mar the beautiful skyline with their
boxed, concealed rooftops.

[36mBefore These Crowded Streets[0;37m
    The fabled docks of the city of Port Balifor stretch to the north from
this point. As people move back and forth around you, you decide that
moving is probably safer than standing still in the middle of the great
crowd. This mass of people prevents you from seeing the northern end of the
docks, but it does not prevent you from taking in an awesome view of the
Bay of Balifor to the west.

    You find yourself upon the shallow waters in the Bay of Balifor, where
fisherman often come to ply their trade. The water here is calm and fish
can be seen roaming and darting through the shallow waters below through
drifting seaweed. To the east stand the dockyards of Port Balifor, with the
bay stretching out to the west and south.

    The protective reef, which rims the shoreline, is clearly visible here.
It rises a few feet from the water. The stone reef not only stops the flow
of red water, but it also blocks all attempts to sail towards the shoreline
or from the shoreline. Here, the rocky shore of the coastline is quite
rugged and steep. The wreckage of a ship is here.

    The protective reef, which rims the shoreline, is clearly visible here.
It rises a few feet from the water. The stone reef not only stops the flow
of red water, but it also blocks all attempts to sail towards the shoreline
or from the shoreline. Here, the rocky shore of the coastline is quite
gentle. You can see a large fault on the shoreline, where the red sediments
overlie the dense black volcanic basalt. The fault dips steeply to the
northwest, and the black rock abruptly disappears under the red sediments.

    Looking down you notice a very odd water color. The water appears to be
a pinkish color, which would normally be a very odd occurance in any other
part of the world. The red water from the Blood Sea to the north is
mingling within this straight with the clear water of the Great Western
Ocean to the south creating the odd colored water.

    Your feet sink into the deep and warm sand as you walk along the sandy
beach. The atmosphere is very calm and reassuring. Waves broke lazily onto
the shore. At the west end of the beach there raises a cliff which seem to
be impassable. The mountainside which resides far at the eastern part of
the beach is less steep but filled with treacherous, loose rocks.
Apparently there has been many landslides from the eastern mountain, since
the beach and the water is filled with rocks of many different sizes. The
forest straight to the north and to the northeast is dark where appears to
be no movement but some strange shadows. The forest is also very thick and
filled with torn bushes. Some way from the waterline there are some quite
large sand dunes.

[36mA Sand Beach[0;37m
    In every step your foot leaves a deep depression into the sand of the
beach. Because of that the walking is rather tiresome but luckily the beach
is so small that everyone can walk from one end to another without much
difficulties. Eventually the beach ends to the mountain side full of loose
and dangerous rocks. There are lot of rocks in the water as well as in the
forest. The rocks in the forest are covered with ages old moss and vines.
Some of the rocks are small enough so that you could move them, but no way
you could clear the beach nor the mountain side from all the rocks which
prevents you from climbing up to the mountain. The forest is full of
strange shadows that gives you creeps.

    The gates of the black tower are, surprisingly, black. A paved walkway
leads to two large metal doors. There is some odd symbols carved onto the
doors. A stone figure of a two headed dragon is attached above the iron
gates. The tower has no windows. You have a strange feeling the statue of
the dragon is staring at you. The walkway which leads to the gates is
surrounded by thick mist.

    The hall is very large. In every wall there are doors. The doors
are made of wood but the western door is made of black metal. The walls are
lined with large weapon racks filled with rusty and dented equipment. At
the middle of the hall there is a small rectangular area which has been the
training place for the tower guard. The hall is illuminated by multitude of
torches. Still the room is full of strange shadows.

are made of wood but the western door is made of black metal. The walls are

training place for the tower guard. The hall is illuminated by multitude of
torches. Still the room is full of strange shadows.

[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
carried on the sea breeze, the occasional flash of white in the sky
confirms this. The smells and sounds of many horses comes from the east,
where some wooden stables have been built, while to the west is a
warehouse.

[36mA Sandy Shoreline[0;37m
    Your feet sink into the deep and warm sand as you walk along the sandy
beach. The atmosphere is very calm and reassuring. Waves broke lazily onto
the shore. At the west end of the beach there raises a cliff which seem to
be impassable. The mountainside which resides far at the eastern part of
the beach is less steep but filled with treacherous, loose rocks.
Apparently there has been many landslides from the eastern mountain, since
the beach and the water is filled with rocks of many different sizes. The
forest straight to the north and to the northeast is dark where appears to
be no movement but some strange shadows. The forest is also very thick and
filled with torn bushes. Some way from the waterline there are some quite
large sand dunes.

[36mA Sand Beach[0;37m
    In every step your foot leaves a deep depression into the sand of the
beach. Because of that the walking is rather tiresome but luckily the beach
is so small that everyone can walk from one end to another without much
difficulties. Eventually the beach ends to the mountain side full of loose
and dangerous rocks. There are lot of rocks in the water as well as in the
forest. The rocks in the forest are covered with ages old moss and vines.
Some of the rocks are small enough so that you could move them, but no way
you could clear the beach nor the mountain side from all the rocks which
prevents you from climbing up to the mountain. The forest is full of
strange shadows that gives you creeps.

The griffon is a powerful animal with a coat of fur like rays of sun.
Sprouting from its back are impressive wings of white feathers with dark

hardiest of armor.
A griffon looks pretty hurt (poisoned).

one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that

    Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.

trading centre for Krynn. All travellers are welcome in Port Balifor but
one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that
call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and
expansive slums, Balifor is not home for the meek.

    Tired and weary, you drag your aching feet along the narrow road that
passes through the north gate of Balifor. A tall city wall surrounds the
port on its three open sides, an indication of its trading wealth and
prosperous people. The sea off Balifor is reputedly vicious for the
inexperienced, defending the town well.

prosperous people. The sea off Balifor is reputedly vicious for the
inexperienced, defending the town well.

travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north

near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from

the north out of sight. Before the base of the mountains lies the beginning
of Throtyl Gap, the boundary of bandit and goblin country. East, the
foothills cross the badlands, leading towards Taman Busuk and the
Khalkists.

[36mBeside the Dargaard Mountains[0;37m
    The road here leads around the Dargaard mountains past the Nightlund
plains. Small shrubs and dusty looking grasses are growing sporadically
around the road. Small rocks and pebbles lie haphazardly around the road
victims of an avalanche from above. A grinning skull sits on the eastern
side of the road, warning all who pass to beware.

    Mountains rise above you on three sides. The road here is set in a dip
between two mountains and heads down the mountain to the south. Gravel and
small boulders are scattered along the road probably from numerous
avalanches. To the east the ruins of a burned out castle rise out of the
mountains.

    The road here is steep and hard to follow as it travels around the
Dargaard Mountains. West of you the nightmarish Nightlund plains start,
stomping ground of Soth's terrible spirit minions. The rocks here are worn
and ancient looking, as if this is the oldest part of Ansalon. Grass does
not grow here at all.

    Grass grows here in ragged patches among the blackened soil. The road
here is extremely rough and horses must have trouble navigating this
section of it. North of you the Nightlund plains continue while to the east
the Dargaard mountains can be seen in the distance. Around you large stones
lie strewn about the landscape as if they were scattered by some

    The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy scent of saltwater to the air, marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

    You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the
river there is a path heading north.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward

seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

intersect in this residential area of Vingaard. The city walls rise about
twenty feet into the air, towering over your head as they stretch the
length of Eastern Perimeter to the north and south. Few things but houses
are visible as you look up and down Eastern Perimeter. The houses do not
appear to be as expensive as some others in Vingaard, but still look like
very comfortable places to live. Eastern Avenue extends west to the center
of Vingaard, while Eastern Perimeter Road heads north and south.

    This section of Eastern Avenue passes through a mixture of commercial

commercial buildings lay towards the west edge of this block, close to
Market Street, while the residential occupy the central and eastern parts.
The houses, although not lavish, grand and expensive like some in Vingaard,
are well kept and clean. Many have small stone paths leading to their front
doors, but nearly all have large gates that have been locked, preventing
entrance.

    The smell of baking bread lingers sweetly in the air above this

economic center of Vingaard, the stores located along Market Street provide
an array of services to both the general populace of the town and any
adventurers passing through. Lamp posts stand on each side of the street,
allowing enough light during the night for some of the businesses to stay
open. Eastern Avenue extends east to the city walls and west underneath a

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large

wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's

    The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, and impressive
fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town, and a
small road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is a
small two-story stone structure, the tollhouse, used to collect taxes from
people passing through the area.

obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The occasional
bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
road extends west-northwest toward Palanthas and east-southeast to
Vingaard, its keep perched atop a hill barely visible on the horizon.

[36mA Road Through the Vingaard Mountains[0;37m
    This well traveled road gently winds its way up the Vingaard Mountains,
hugging the edges of the mountainsides. The area is fairly rocky, but there
are some small patches of trees here and there, a bit of snow still hanging
on their branches. A few hearty birds remain despite the cold, their song
clear in the crisp air. The road gently slopes upward as it heads to the
west, but takes a steep dip down to the base of the mountains to the east.

[36mNear Westgate Pass[0;37m
    Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching
higher than any other structure on Krynn. The tower, an ancient bastion of
the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in
the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To the
south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.

    A large portcullis to the north bodes fair warning to those that would
attempt to storm the tower. Beyond the portcullis lies the pride of the
Solamnic Knighthood, the High Clerist Tower. The tower represents a shining
example for the citizens across all Krynn, and legend has it that while the
faithful stand on the walls, the tower shall not fall. Eastwards lies a
small path around the tower walls.

    The pathway around the tower walls is quite narrow, allowing very
little movement. This path appears to have been much wider at one point,
but additions to the tower walls have brought it down to just a few feet
wide. Small stones fall from the mountain side above, striking the ground
constantly. Several small cracks are visible in the tower wall here,
indicating a possible weakness in the towers defenses.

    The pathway continues to shrink, what was once a massive highway, is
now little more than a foot trail. The mountain, with its sheer face, and
towering height, stands here, providing an excellent addition to the already
massive tower walls. Small stones rain down from the mountain side, a
possible precursor for things to come. The defenders of the tower can be
heard overhead, marching along the ramparts, ready for battle.

    Looking to the west, a massive stone wall blocks the pass, leaving few
options for movement here. The narrowness of the trail leaves very little
room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

    A massive stone wall continues from the tower into the stone face of
the mountain, impeding northbound progress. Moss has begun to grow on the
wall, as upkeep in this area would be a lot of work. A small opening in the
wall appears to have been formed here, leaving just enough room for someone
to pass through. Several sets of footprints, visible in the dirt here, lead
through the opening here, showing that this passage is still traveled.

    The ground here is relatively flat, with nothing around. Small plants
sprout up from the ground, but aside from that this room is relatively
boring. A short ways off to the south you see two large mountains, their
peaks hidden in the clouds.

[36mBefore the Pass[0;37m
    Two large mountains nearly meet towards the south, forming a narrow
pass between. Looking up at the mountains you marvel at their size, they
seem to be holding up the heavens! Their peaks dissapear into the clouds,
you wonder what the view is like so far above the earth. The pass looks
as though it is well used, there are several tracks leading to it.

[36mIn a Dark Tunnel[0;37m
    As you look around the tunnel you notice something strange about the
lighting: you notice the darkness. It fills the room like a thick fog,
impeding your vision so much, you can scarcely trace the outline of your
hand in front of your face. Try as you might, you cannot discern where the
walls of the tunnel are, until you meet them, usually with your face. It's
probably an improvement.

    Far to the north you can see the city of Palanthas in its entirety. Its
beautiful spires, the dark tower of High Sorcery, its unguarded gates.
Looking back at the fortress to your southwest, you realize how valuable,
strategically, this mountainside is. The path makes a sudden turn to the
south here, so sudden you barely notice in time to stop yourself from
walking off into the vast empty air which abrubtly takes the place of the
path eastward. The path to the south appears to lead to some huge iron
gates, the only break in the huge stone walls you have yet to observe.

    The knights in this part of the courtyard are not absorbed in their
training as the other Knights are, but rather they are more entranced by
licking their wounds, waiting to call upon the services of the Skull
Knights. Since there is no obvious area designated for the clerics, the
young Knights in training usually collapse in a small area and wait for a
Skull to wander into shouting range.

    The Knights here are training with quarterstaffs composed of tree limbs and
cloth wrapping to help prevent painful splinters. Scattered around the floor
are the shattered remains of staffs that have served their purpose, not even
tossed into a pile. Picking up the remains of one of the staffs, you come
to the conclusion that there is a reason these are only used for training,
and that reason is: They're junk.

observe the intersection, you note that there are numerous sailors
staggering from the local bars to their ships at all times of day. You also
notice traders conversing both with themselves and the local shopkeepers.

    The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty
odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, passing
between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy
fishermen.

    As you step through the gates you see the two plain towers which you
assume serve as guard towers, however you can't make out any openings or

ending at the side of the mountain, in which you can make out the opening
leading on into darkness.

     Carved out of the mountain is the Dark Knight's outpost, hidden from
the outside world. The floor is rough, with dirt and pebbles lying about.
The lighting is poor, causing you to strain as you search about for guards.
Dark shadows dance across the walls, making you nervous as you set out
searching the area. The smell of food drifts from the north, while darkness
only allures your attention to the west.

    You have come to an intersection in the tunnels. Something seems strange
about this room, but you can't seem to determine what that is. From the west
you hear the sounds of snoring and occasionally the high pitched sound of
metal meeting metal rings out. The southern tunnel is draped in a darkness
that your torches cannot penetrate. You can hear a low, chant coming from
that direction. Oddly there is a small grate set into the floor here, with
no trace of any liquid having ever flowed through it.

symbols to his dark queen. A dark stone altar is against the southern wall,
polished to a delicate shine. Two black wax candles are placed on either end of
the altar, casting two dark shadows of the knight on opposite ends of the room.
A plain bed also adds no glamour to the room, with its bedding undisturbed for
ages.  The only exit lies to the north.

[36mThe Skull Champion's Chamber[0;37m
    The chamber of the Skull Champion is plain and undecorative, save the
symbols to his dark queen. A dark stone altar is against the southern wall,
polished to a delicate shine. Two black wax candles are placed on either end of
the altar, casting two dark shadows of the knight on opposite ends of the room.
A plain bed also adds no glamour to the room, with its bedding undisturbed for
ages.  The only exit lies to the north.

about this room, but you can't seem to determine what that is. From the west
you hear the sounds of snoring and occasionally the high pitched sound of
metal meeting metal rings out. The southern tunnel is draped in a darkness
that your torches cannot penetrate. You can hear a low, chant coming from
that direction. Oddly there is a small grate set into the floor here, with
no trace of any liquid having ever flowed through it.

you hear the sounds of snoring and occasionally the high pitched sound of
metal meeting metal rings out. The southern tunnel is draped in a darkness
that your torches cannot penetrate. You can hear a low, chant coming from
that direction. Oddly there is a small grate set into the floor here, with
no trace of any liquid having ever flowed through it.

[36mA Large Cavern[0;37m
    The walls of this cavern are lined with numerous torches. Each torch
omits very little light, but the combined effect is nearly blinding. A solid
oak door is set in the western wall, and the small opening in the eastern
wall leads into darkness. To the south a thick sheet of glass has been
raised to block entry to the tunnel behind it.

    The walls of this cavern are lined with numerous torches. Each torch
omits very little light, but the combined effect is nearly blinding. A solid
oak door is set in the western wall, and the small opening in the eastern
wall leads into darkness. To the south a thick sheet of glass has been
raised to block entry to the tunnel behind it.

[36mIn the Prison[0;37m
    The prison is dark and dank, likely uncomfortable for the luckless
occupants captured by the Dark Knights. A few Lily Knights stand guard,
keeping a watchful eye over the captured souls. The darkness makes it hard
for you to see if there is anyone actually behind the bars of each cell.
Looking around, you decide it is best to keep moving before you join the
prisoners of this compound.

    The prison is dimly lit an unseen source. An occasional groan can be
heard, piercing through the silence, but then all is quiet once again.
Oddly, no Knights can be seen patrolling here, whatever means the Knights
here use, to ensure that the prisoners do no attempt to flee, they must be
working, as there are few vacant cells.

    As you step through the gates you see the two plain towers which you
assume serve as guard towers, however you can't make out any openings or
windows in the sides of them. A small courtyard opens up in front of you,
ending at the side of the mountain, in which you can make out the opening
leading on into darkness.

[36mThe Entrance to the Outpost[0;37m
     Carved out of the mountain is the Dark Knight's outpost, hidden from
the outside world. The floor is rough, with dirt and pebbles lying about.
The lighting is poor, causing you to strain as you search about for guards.
Dark shadows dance across the walls, making you nervous as you set out
searching the area. The smell of food drifts from the north, while darkness
only allures your attention to the west.

    You have come to an intersection in the tunnels. Something seems strange
about this room, but you can't seem to determine what that is. From the west
you hear the sounds of snoring and occasionally the high pitched sound of
metal meeting metal rings out. The southern tunnel is draped in a darkness
that your torches cannot penetrate. You can hear a low, chant coming from
that direction. Oddly there is a small grate set into the floor here, with
no trace of any liquid having ever flowed through it.

omits very little light, but the combined effect is nearly blinding. A solid
oak door is set in the western wall, and the small opening in the eastern
wall leads into darkness. To the south a thick sheet of glass has been
raised to block entry to the tunnel behind it.

    The prison is dark and dank, likely uncomfortable for the luckless
occupants captured by the Dark Knights. A few Lily Knights stand guard,
keeping a watchful eye over the captured souls. The darkness makes it hard
for you to see if there is anyone actually behind the bars of each cell.
Looking around, you decide it is best to keep moving before you join the
prisoners of this compound.

of the light cast by your torches. This portion of the prison feels somehow
unnaturally cold, a cold that pierces through your armor and flesh, chilling
you down to the bone. No guards have been stationed here, leaving questions
in your mind as to what keeps the prisoners from fleeing. Peering into the

[36mIn the Prison[0;37m

of the light cast by your torches. This portion of the prison feels somehow
unnaturally cold, a cold that pierces through your armor and flesh, chilling
you down to the bone. No guards have been stationed here, leaving questions
in your mind as to what keeps the prisoners from fleeing. Peering into the
cells, you see that most prisoners are cowering against the far walls.
