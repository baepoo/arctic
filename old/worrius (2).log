[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.

[36mTraders Square[0;37m
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

    Dock Road and High Street meet here in a three way junction. As you
observe the intersection, you note that there are numerous sailors
staggering from the local bars to their ships at all times of day. You also
notice traders conversing both with themselves and the local shopkeepers.
They are buying and selling the wares that they use to make a living.

    You stand here at the end of the Western Pier, fighting the crowd to
get to your destination. This pier is by far the busiest and largest of the
three major piers belonging to the city, and the immense rush of people
serves as a testament to this fact. You are thankful for the presence of
the Balifor Watchmen on the docks, as you are almost too busy gazing at
strange travelers to watch your own purse.

docked further down the pier. You keep one hand on your money purse and the
other on your weapon as you make your way through this crowded area.

    It appears that this ship was constructed for the purpose of ferrying
people on short journeys across the Bay, or perhaps to nearby settlements,
towns, and cities. Perhaps because of the presence of the dragonarmies,
this company has fallen on slow times as few seem to be paying for such
transportation. This once beautiful boat has fallen into hard times and ill
repair.

[36mAt the Helm of a Passenger Ship[0;37m
    Standing near the helm of this ship, you are suprised at the lack of
navigational equipment. You determine that this ship could hardly handle
rough open waters, so it stands to reason that a good captain could easily
navigate with only a detailed knowledge of the coastline. This fact makes
the presence of a good, sober captain a must in order for this ship to
sail.

[36mThe Midsection of a Passenger Ship[0;37m
    It appears that this ship was constructed for the purpose of ferrying
people on short journeys across the Bay, or perhaps to nearby settlements,
towns, and cities. Perhaps because of the presence of the dragonarmies,
this company has fallen on slow times as few seem to be paying for such
transportation. This once beautiful boat has fallen into hard times and ill
repair.

    Dock Road and High Street meet here in a three way junction. As you
observe the intersection, you note that there are numerous sailors
staggering from the local bars to their ships at all times of day. You also
notice traders conversing both with themselves and the local shopkeepers.
They are buying and selling the wares that they use to make a living.

    The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty
odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, passing
between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy
fishermen.

    The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty
odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, passing
between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy
fishermen.

[36mShallow Bay Waters[0;37m
    You find yourself upon the shallow waters in the Bay of Balifor, where
fisherman often come to ply their trade. The water here is calm and fish
can be seen roaming and darting through the shallow waters below through
drifting seaweed. To the east stand the dockyards of Port Balifor, with the
bay stretching out to the west and south.

[36mBefore These Crowded Streets[0;37m
    The fabled docks of the city of Port Balifor stretch to the north from
this point. As people move back and forth around you, you decide that
moving is probably safer than standing still in the middle of the great
crowd. This mass of people prevents you from seeing the northern end of the
docks, but it does not prevent you from taking in an awesome view of the
Bay of Balifor to the west.

this company has fallen on slow times as few seem to be paying for such

there is a faint smell of ashes and old smoke. A symbol of death appears to

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

knows, a light in the dark means that there is something there. Whether it
is a warm meal and a good conversation or a silent blade is unfortunately

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

     You are now nearing what seems to be the center of the Brog camp. You
can spot little broglings scuttling about with their parents frequently
here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other
hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard, cold
stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various huts
and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

     Sloping dunes of sand sweep around you, completely dominating the
scenery. Not much can be seen here, but every once in a while you notice
thin, spidery pockets of sand drawn up towards the sky in the buffeting
winds. Here you can almost smell somthing different in the air, perhaps
bordering between freshly killed food, and the old stench of death.

     Breaking off the main road, your eyes perceive an arid desert of
immense proportions. The air is thick and heavy with obscene amounts of
heat, causing your line of sight to ripple in the distance. A slight wind
blows in from the south, most likely from the Southern Courrain Ocean.
However, it offers no relief - just more stale, dry air.

    You have reached a crossroads of sorts. A small path leads off to the

appears to be a crude settlement. Smoke rises in the air and the smell of
food makes your stomach rumble. Somewhere to the south lies the port town
of Balifor.

at the edge of the desert plains. The road beneath your feet is nothing

travellers that have walked this path before you. Sparse vegetation and a
lack of trees make your journey a rather mundane one. A faint breeze

    The trading section of the blacksmithy is a little cleaner than the

you and warms your chilled body. On the walls are multitudes of iron racks,
encompassing all the armor and weapons you are ever likely to need.
Unfortunately, some of the better ones are in cabinets with 'Not for sale'
signs on them. Still, there are some very good offers around.

    The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. Traders
can be seen travelling down this to and from the inns of Balifor at all
times of day or night.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    The trading section of the blacksmithy is a little cleaner than the
rest of the building, but not much. The heat from the furnace sweeps over
you and warms your chilled body. On the walls are multitudes of iron racks,
encompassing all the armor and weapons you are ever likely to need.
Unfortunately, some of the better ones are in cabinets with 'Not for sale'
signs on them. Still, there are some very good offers around.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
