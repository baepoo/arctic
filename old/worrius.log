Tavi arrives from above.
[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort

[36mThe End of the West Pier[0;37m
    You stand here at the end of the Western Pier, fighting the crowd to
get to your destination. This pier is by far the busiest and largest of the
three major piers belonging to the city, and the immense rush of people
serves as a testament to this fact. You are thankful for the presence of
the Balifor Watchmen on the docks, as you are almost too busy gazing at
strange travelers to watch your own purse.

[36mAlong the West Pier[0;37m
    Standing on this end of the West Pier, you are shoulder to shoulder
with all manner of people. Merchants wander to and from the ship anchored
to the south, and fishermen pull tremendous loads of fish from the ship
docked further down the pier. You keep one hand on your money purse and the
other on your weapon as you make your way through this crowded area.

[36mThe Midsection of a Passenger Ship[0;37m
    It appears that this ship was constructed for the purpose of ferrying
people on short journeys across the Bay, or perhaps to nearby settlements,
towns, and cities. Perhaps because of the presence of the dragonarmies,
this company has fallen on slow times as few seem to be paying for such
transportation. This once beautiful boat has fallen into hard times and ill
repair.

this company has fallen on slow times as few seem to be paying for such
transportation. This once beautiful boat has fallen into hard times and ill

the impression that this room has aged years more than the rest of the

    This cabin looks as if it belonged to one of the former guests aboard
this ship. It has simple furnishings and decorations. There is a closet
here, in the wall to the west. The ever-present smell that has spread all
over the ship seems to be better here than elsewhere. Perhaps the open
porthole has released some of the foul stench.

to the south, and fishermen pull tremendous loads of fish from the ship
docked further down the pier. You keep one hand on your money purse and the
other on your weapon as you make your way through this crowded area.

    You stand here at the end of the Western Pier, fighting the crowd to
get to your destination. This pier is by far the busiest and largest of the
three major piers belonging to the city, and the immense rush of people
serves as a testament to this fact. You are thankful for the presence of
the Balifor Watchmen on the docks, as you are almost too busy gazing at
strange travelers to watch your own purse.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

slightly hunched over, not the most comfortable of spaces, but it could be

    Little natural light filters down from the grate above your head. What
little light does penetrate the darkness reveals a small and rough-hewn
tunnel. The tunnel is wide enough for two men to walk abreast and only
slightly hunched over, not the most comfortable of spaces, but it could be
far worse. No matter how much light is present shadows still coat the
tunnel, hiding nooks and crannies that would be perfect for the
enterprising thief or assassin.

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mAt the Helm of a Passenger Ship[0;37m
    Standing near the helm of this ship, you are suprised at the lack of
navigational equipment. You determine that this ship could hardly handle
rough open waters, so it stands to reason that a good captain could easily
navigate with only a detailed knowledge of the coastline. This fact makes
the presence of a good, sober captain a must in order for this ship to
sail.

[36mThe Midsection of a Passenger Ship[0;37m
    It appears that this ship was constructed for the purpose of ferrying
people on short journeys across the Bay, or perhaps to nearby settlements,
towns, and cities. Perhaps because of the presence of the dragonarmies,
this company has fallen on slow times as few seem to be paying for such
transportation. This once beautiful boat has fallen into hard times and ill
repair.

odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, to the
east and west, passing small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the
hardy fishermen.

    The street ends in a rough-shod barricade. For some unknown reason, the
peasants that once lived here seem to have left and tried to stop outsiders
from entering this area. Several burnt torches have been stuck into the
walls, finding niches and holes in the crude furniture that has been used
in a futile effort. It seems that had the barricade not been there, you
could probably have found a way to get back to the main square from here. A
tall, deserted house lies to the west, its door has been forced open and
there is a faint smell of ashes and old smoke. A symbol of death appears to
have been carved into the wood surround with a knife.

in a futile effort. It seems that had the barricade not been there, you

    The ground becomes much more rocky here, as three paths extend from
here. To the south you can see a system of hills skirting the Khalkists. To
the west of here is the eastern edge of the Khalkists, while to the east
are the Loft Hills.

    Sloping down here, this hill is literally covered with mountain goats
grazing on grass. Clouds pass overhead, and the air is fresh and clean. The
path itself is dark and of clay, and a few rocks skirt it. It doesn't look
as if many people pass through here.

as you enter the dense forest, far north of Balifor, nestled in the Loft

leap from tree to tree, not paying you any attention. A small intermittent
stream twists and turns through the bottom of the small valley, beckoning
you onward. Also, a few bizarre looking birds fly overhead, occasionally
breaking the dense forest canopy.

much larger here, with carvings in them, denoting presence of something

forest grows considerably thicker here compared to the rest of the forest,
almost as if forming city walls. The trees also appear to be carefully
molded and shaped by a force much more intelligent and much less chaotic
than nature. Unable to see anything past the trees blocking your path
southward, humility washes over you. Whomever made it probably didn't want
to be disturbed.

     The familiar clatter and chirps of the wildlife fade as you travel
further down the faded path. The stream, before intermittent, now travels
directly north-south, staying above ground and widening. Small fish swim to
the surface, jabbing at the occasional dragonfly or tick. The trees grow
much larger here, with carvings in them, denoting presence of something
unbeknownst to you. The path, once fairly visible, now fades off and
becomes almost unnoticable to the unaided eye.

as you enter the dense forest, far north of Balifor, nestled in the Loft
Hills Valley. Off into the distance, small woodland creatures playfully
leap from tree to tree, not paying you any attention. A small intermittent

you onward. Also, a few bizarre looking birds fly overhead, occasionally
breaking the dense forest canopy. To the north the path continues, leading
you out of the forest, and back into the rest of the world.

    You find yourself in a muddy, tree-filled nook in the hills. The
vegetation in this area has grown unchecked, overrunning almost everything.
To the north stands a gate that looks to be held together only by the will
of gravity; one touch might send it toppling. Beyond the gate lies a
collection of shoddy huts and muddy paths. To the south and west lie more
trees and a few hills which climb into the distance.

furniture has been stripped from it except for two crude straw pallets on
the ground. An iron door in the southern wall leads outside, and a wooden

    Similar in most way to the other buildings in the outpost, this shack
is of dubious construction. Its wooden walls and ceiling do not look
particularly rigid to you, though they are noticeably stronger than those
of the other structures here. There is no furniture here, and most of the
room remains empty. The crude floor is made from hard-packed dirt, and a
heavy iron door to the north marks the only exit from this shack.

    Apparently, this is what passes for an eating establishment in this
outpost. Dirty dishes and rotting scraps of food are scattered everywhere,
and a potent odor pervades the room. Strangely enough, there are no tables
or chairs in here. An entryway leads east into what seems to be a kitchen,
and the disconcerting smell seems to grow stronger in that direction. In
addition, a rickety wooden door to the north leads outside.

    Serving as the kitchen facility for the outpost, this fairly large room
is an extension of the building housing the mess hall. A firepit sits in
the center of the room, and an iron cauldron full of vile glop bubbles over
it. Rusty eating and cooking implements are scattered across the dirty
counters. The air is filled with a stomach-churning smell that seems to
come from everywhere. Roaches and rats scurry about, adding to the lack of
cleanliness. A small entryway leads west into the mess hall.

of the buildings have been overrun by the scraggly plant life. The ground
is really nothing more than a thick layer of mud, and remains completely

    This road follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. A glittering expanse of
blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that
sways the few trees that manage to grow along this road. To the north you
see a crossroads, while south of here the road follows the sea to Port
Balifor.

    Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south. The saline smell of the sea is
slight in the air, hardly noticeable, though it is obvious that the
glittering, placid waters of the Khurman Sea are not far off. Curving north
and west, the dusty road continues along the rolling plains.
