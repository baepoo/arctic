    The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a narrow
stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers are
clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously and
planning their campaigns in muted tones.

friendly tavern lies to the south, and the road runs east and west.

granite with a greenish cast, quarried from the mountains to the east.
Along the way are various plinths and sculptures making the road appear

[36mEntrance to the Sewers[0;37m
     The abandoned sewer ways of Tarsis have long decayed and rotted away
to practically nothing. Long ago, when the great city of Tarsis thrived as
the largest sea port in Ansalon, these sewer ways carried all the waste of
the city out to the sea, where it was washed away. When the cataclysm hit,
there was no longer a sea to wash away the waste, so the citizens built a
new aqueduct to properly dispose of waste. The old sewer ways were buried
under the rubble of the buildings lost in the cataclysm. The old sewer ways
were forgotten and left to rot beneath the rebuilt city. It was the vermin,
and low lifes who made this once proud system their homes. You stand under
an archway that leads into the sewer system. To the north you see a long
slime-covered passage that leads into the main section of the sewer ways.
To the south, you see a tunnel of sewage and waste, and on the east wall
you can see a ladder leading up to a porthole.

the sewage is being flooded, then go down to make sure that it was all
flushed out ok. Though now, it looks as though something has made its home
here. Bones are strewn about the room, and junk is piled into one corner of
the room. The only exit is a service shaft that leads down.

It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the change in light, but after
you do, you look at your surroundings. You see a long hallway that is
better lit to the north, and you can hear light, padded footsteps coming
from that direction. To the south lies the hidden door to the guild, and to
the north you can see an intersection up ahead.

you heard earlier have ceased, and been replaced with the sounds of loud
laughter coming from the east. To the north the hallway continues on, and a

hangs over the top of it, blocking out the light that comes from somewhere.

     This room is lavishly decorated with the finest materials Tarsis has
to offer, and even some Tarsis doesn't have to offer. Red curtains are hung
on all the walls, and a huge red armoir stands against the north wall. In
the center is a huge bed with red blankets and sheets. A black silk canopy
hangs over the top of it, blocking out the light that comes from somewhere.
Judging by most of the items you see lying in this room alone, you can tell
that whoever lives here must have a lot of money to spend on the finer
things. Through a large door to the south you can see the light of another

     This room is lavishly decorated with the finest materials Tarsis has
to offer, and even some Tarsis doesn't have to offer. Red curtains are hung
on all the walls, and a huge red armoir stands against the north wall. In
the center is a huge bed with red blankets and sheets. A black silk canopy
hangs over the top of it, blocking out the light that comes from somewhere.
Judging by most of the items you see lying in this room alone, you can tell
that whoever lives here must have a lot of money to spend on the finer
things. Through a large door to the south you can see the light of another
room.

To the north of the room is a large mahogany desk with papers organized
neatly into stacks on top of it. The room is nicely decorated in expensive
curtains and tapestries showing scenes of Tarsis when it was the largest
port in all of Ansalon. Waves crash against the once beautiful beaches of
the majestic sea port. To the south, colors dance into the room from the
strange light, and to the northwest you can see a large door.

     You step through an illusion of a wall and into a side passage of the
main sewer way, leading north. For the first time in a while, your feet
touch dry stone, and not slime. This passage seems much cleaner than the
others. The floor is dry and barren. This passage continues north, while a
wall lies to the south.

[36mEnd of the Main Sewer Way[0;37m
     The main sewer way ends here at a huge stone wall. There is a huge
grate that lies on the floor and the sewage that is here flows into it. The
stench here is even worse than the rest of the sewers. It brings the
familiar smell of death to your nose. You can hear something very large
moving beneath the sewer grate. To the east, the main sewer way continues.

     The main sewer way is wet and slimy, with small creatures you can't
make out swimming through the muck. You cringe in disgust as you step
amongst the sewage that is left here to ferment. The smell is overwhelming
and you can barely manage to maintain your balance. Your head is reeling
and your feet are slipping on the slime-covered stones of the passage. As
you look down at the muck, you see that the water is flowing in an easterly
direction.

[36mCrumbling Aqueduct[0;37m
     This crumbling aqueduct used to carry all the waste out to the sea
from the rest of the sewer system. Now, it is corroded and rotted to the
point of almost collapsing. You take tentative steps onto it. It seems very
dangerous and unstable. The aqueduct is shaking and crumbling beneath your
feet as you walk along it. To the west, the aqueduct has collapsed and
allows no further passage. Back to the east the aqueduct continues, and
above your head you can see a very rusted iron ladder leading up through a
small shaft.

     This room is a service room where the maintenance men would wait while
the sewage is being flooded, then go down to make sure that it was all
flushed out ok. Though now, it looks as though something has made its home
here. Bones are strewn about the room, and junk is piled into one corner of
the room. The only exit is a service shaft that leads down.

[36mEntrance to the Sewers[0;37m
     The abandoned sewer ways of Tarsis have long decayed and rotted away
to practically nothing. Long ago, when the great city of Tarsis thrived as
the largest sea port in Ansalon, these sewer ways carried all the waste of
the city out to the sea, where it was washed away. When the cataclysm hit,
there was no longer a sea to wash away the waste, so the citizens built a
new aqueduct to properly dispose of waste. The old sewer ways were buried
under the rubble of the buildings lost in the cataclysm. The old sewer ways
were forgotten and left to rot beneath the rebuilt city. It was the vermin,
and low lifes who made this once proud system their homes. You stand under
an archway that leads into the sewer system. To the north you see a long
slime-covered passage that leads into the main section of the sewer ways.
To the south, you see a tunnel of sewage and waste, and on the east wall
you can see a ladder leading up to a porthole.

Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

a dry valley. It looks almost like a canyon, as it is very dry and you can
see no plants growing. Perhaps it was a pre-cataclysm river, though
whatever ancient waters have flowed there have since dried up. The winds
from the glacier south of here die down somewhat, though a steady,
relentless northern breeze drifting from the Plains of Dust can still

    Crawling up the western ridge of the valley, this road begins and ends
its ascent here, with a small road leading south towards a small town.
Wisps of smoke drift up into the calm, cold air, carrying with it the
sounds of the small village, though they are distant and small. Nothing
grows here, nor can you see any signs of trees or other vegetation along
the path as it winds its way up into the mountains. Several large boulders
break the stifling monotony of this path.

this rather uninteresting, barren plain. The soil is sandy and rocky, and
as a result of this almost no vegetation grows here. A chilly, bitter
breeze whirls about you, sending pebbles from the road flying into your
face. The sounds of a river drift in from the east.

    This is a dry, dusty riverbank on the Torath River. Small, dried up
shrubs line the muddy banks of this small, rushing river, and the air here
is slightly colder due to the mist from the river. Although you see no
signs of life in the river from here, several poor looking fishermen walk
along the banks with shoddy poles. The sound of rushing water hang heavily
in the cold air, and a large wooden bridge crosses the river to the east.

barbaric humans that pass you seem apprehensive. Smoke drifts lazily by,
carrying with it the smell of roasting lion meat. Nestled near the

deep within the heart of these gently rolling foothills. Looking into the

mother with a trail of children behind her. The stone huts spew thin, black
wisps of smoke into the cold air. Sparse forest surrounds the settlement,

    Looming over the desert like a giant, you see a city to the north.
Fortified and extremely large, the city seems shrouded in a veil of sand
and heat waves. To the west the road seeps into the endless dunes of which
this road is flanked to both the north and the south. Far to the southeast
lies the fabled city of Port Balifor.

    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroads east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies down a
bit, replaced with the cawing of vultures overhead.

    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroads is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea north of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

The road slowly bends, wide enough so that many wagons can pass by each

saltwater. The occasional fisherman drifts idly by, and the sea is usually
peaceful.

fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    A small brass bell sits on a rosewood table along with a guest book.
There is no need to ring for attention, however; you are getting plenty of
that already. A brass sign assures you of the quarters' legendary comfort.

A ring made from a silver bone lies here...it glows blue
A bulletin board with the heading 'Wanted' has been posted on the far wall.
