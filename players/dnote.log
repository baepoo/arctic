The Goblins of Krynn live their lives in the wilderness beyond settlement
in primitive conditions. They are short, flat-nosed creatures with green
skin. They are around the same size as kenders and almost as quick. The
goblin's life centers around the tribe, where they are born and will most
likely die. Their society is based around the philosophy of "might makes
right." As a group, they rarely look beyond their next meal, battle, or
plunder. Most goblin tribes are semi-nomadic, wandering from place to place
like a plague of bandits, stripping an area until it is despoiled. Or until
the local militia rouses itself. Some few tribes have managed to wrest
small villages from their previous inhabitants. Goblin rule over these
villages rarely outlasts a moon-cycle, but such "goblin towns" are the
highest form of goblin civilization.

Goblins are born killers and Goblins are vicious fighters when angered.
Goblin temper in general, is very short, thus they do a lot of fighting.
Goblins have no shame and will lie, cheat or steal to get what they want.
Their lifestyle and the need to survive in the wilderness has made the
goblin stronger than humans and they have a remarkable ability to heal
wounds faster than any other race.

Goblins are far from the smartest or wisest races on Krynn and are not
known for their discipline, thus they do not make good druids, mages and

    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High Street.
The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the two.
You feel unusually nervous as you walk here, and small movements in the
shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears are
ringing because you are listening so hard.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

where the city dump has taken over the land. Old fish crates and carcasses
of long dead animals leave a particularly unpleasant smell in the air.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

[36mA Side Street[0;37m
    The small street leads in a north-south direction. The smell of
decaying straw breezes past you, upturned wooden hand carts lay scattered
against walls. Some old rotten cabbages due to be taken to market lie in a
small heap. The air is humid and damp, it carries a smell of decay and
death. No wonder the tall houses seem to be empty and devoid of intelligent
life.

[36mBefore These Crowded Streets[0;37m
    The fabled docks of the city of Port Balifor stretch to the north from
this point. As people move back and forth around you, you decide that
moving is probably safer than standing still in the middle of the great
crowd. This mass of people prevents you from seeing the northern end of the
docks, but it does not prevent you from taking in an awesome view of the
Bay of Balifor to the west.

    A good sized, boisterous tavern, the Gutted Fish is famous for its
ruckus patrons and strong ale. Many tables are scattered about, but not
many free seats can be found. A large fire rages in the corner, some people
huddle around it attempting to avoid being seen. A bar occupies the east
wall and is covered in all assortments of alcoholic delights.

[36mThe Gilded Parrot Inn[0;37m
    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

    A small path between two buildings that follows the curve of the city
wall leads from the market to a good sized inn and tavern. The Glided
Parrot Inn stands to the east and appears to be quite a nice establishment
for the wayward traveler. The fish market dominates the exit to the north.
This alley has been kept clean and well lit, probably by the owners of the
inn.

    A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disgarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to the
north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.

[36mOutside the Evil Temple[0;37m
    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

    The road has the feel and smells of death row, yet leads towards big
buildings to the north. There are no signs of life here, a few symbols of
death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

[36mDeath Row[0;37m
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

[36mCorner of a Building[0;37m
    You find yourself at the northwestern corner of the Balifor Jail. The
front steps of the large brick building lie just to the south. The jail has
become a busy place. A steady stream of guards leave and enter through the
reinforced double doors. The smell of blood drifts in from Death Row and
the Executioners Block just off further west. Leading east is a dark alley.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small

the south.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head

    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

     This seems to be the center of operations for the settlement. The
ground here is tiled with stone, unlike the sandy floors present in many
of the other huts. A crude statue sits on display in the middle of the
room, commanding your attention. With the grand entrance behind you, you
can see large doorways leading north, south, and east. Each of them bears
more of the Brogs' strange writing above them.

     A large, throne-like seat is the center of attention in the room,
with a low stone wall running before it. A couple of stone pews can be
seen facing the pedestal. Several stone plaques with Brog writing etched
upon them are on display along the walls, all the makings of a courtroom.
Except, most conventional courts do not come supplied with chains to hold
down whomever testifies.

that the inhabitants of the settlement might find some form of survival.
In addition, you also spot a few crude decorations around the well, and a
couple of large rocks for the creatures to sit upon. You can see paths
leading in all directions, except towards the east. There you can see a
strangely decorated hut, set separately from the rest.

can spot little broglings scuttling about with their parents frequently
here, throwing long, curious gazes your way. Their parents, on the other
hand, take no interest in you and give you nothing more than a hard, cold
stare. Often you spot the majority of the Brog ducking behind various huts
and structures to avoid your gaze, lest they become the next of your
victims.

[36mTraders Square[0;37m
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red Door
south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to the
north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.

stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

[36mOutside the Village of Twendle[0;37m
    You are outside a small village nestled deep within these hills. The
sounds of the village drift from the stone walls of several homes and
stores. Looking into the village, you see many men trading and arguing,
along with the occasional mother with a trail of children behind her. The
stone huts spew thin, black wisps of smoke into the cold air. It is a human
settlement, and the few inhabitants you can see from here look hardy and
well prepared, as does their settlement, for the harsh winters they receive
here.

    Smoke lazily rises into the air, drifting in from the east where you
can see a small village that seems to appear out of nowhere amongst these
gently rolling hills. Larger hills loom to the southeast. Several pine and
deciduous trees dot the hillsides, though other than those and a few shrubs
the hills are rather barren. To the east is the entrance to a small village
while west of here the road bends around the hillsides.

Below you, the River Torath gushes mightly with its blue colour reflecting
the high silt content of this glacially fed river. You shudder to imagine
trying to navigate this rapidly flowing stream and after seeing a large
chunk of ice drift by, you realize that to try to navigate on this river
would be impossible.

along the banks with shoddy poles. The sound of rushing water hang heavily
in the cold air, and a large wooden bridge crosses the river to the east.

[36mA Dry Cold Road[0;37m
    Crawling up the western ridge of the valley, this road begins and ends
its ascent here, with a small road leading south towards a small town.
Wisps of smoke drift up into the calm, cold air, carrying with it the
sounds of the small village, though they are distant and small. Nothing
grows here, nor can you see any signs of trees or other vegetation along
the path as it winds its way up into the mountains. Several large boulders
break the stifling monotony of this path.

and north here. The air looks much more tumultuous to the north, as great,
howling gusts of wind offer a mere prelude to the dry Plains of Dust which
expand to the northwest. As you gaze over the contents of the valley, you
notice a small town nestled deep in the valley. Wisps of black smoke drift
lazily into the air, and signs of life become more apparant as there are
many visible footprints, not yet covered by dust.

    Stretching westward, as far as the eye can see, the great, billowing

a dry valley. It looks almost like a canyon, as it is very dry and you can
see no plants growing. Perhaps it was a pre-cataclysm river, though
whatever ancient waters have flowed there have since dried up. The winds
from the glacier south of here die down somewhat, though a steady,
relentless northern breeze drifting from the Plains of Dust can still
readily be felt.

its way east to where the dust clouds that billow about the plains

lazily in the air when you speak and breath, until a strong gust of wind
destroys them. The landscape is barren and rocky, and your feet are numb

    Here at the east end of New Tarsis, a sturdy gate stands ready to seal
the city from any threat. The finest oak, imported from the northern
forests, swings on stout iron hinges. A heavy iron bar can be slotted into
notches in the walls themselves to prevent the gate's being opened. Stone
walls stretch to the north and south.

    Hidden in what was the cellar of a large building in Old Tarsis lies a
toggled-together meeting room of sorts. Pilfered wood from the various
construction sites forms the ceiling, while the walls are covered as best
they can be with old tarps and pieces of carpeting. In the center of the
room, a smoking, greasy-smelling brazier provides some warmth and light.

incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

    You find yourself outside the east gate of Tarsis. The sounds and
smells of the city greet you warmly; to the west the smell of freshly baked
bread, and the chatter of merchants both drift in on a firm, cold breeze.
Cold, dry, desolate plains expand to the east of you. Cold gusts of wind
swirl about, sending clouds of dust billowing about you. This road is well
travelled by merchants, but only those who are brave enough, or, in some
cases, greedy enough, to brave the freezing winds that roll violently from
the Icewall Glacier, clashing with those of the Plains of Dust.

    Here at the east end of New Tarsis, a sturdy gate stands ready to seal
the city from any threat. The finest oak, imported from the northern
forests, swings on stout iron hinges. A heavy iron bar can be slotted into
notches in the walls themselves to prevent the gate's being opened. Stone
walls stretch to the north and south.

[36mEntrance to the Sewers[0;37m
     The abandoned sewer ways of Tarsis have long decayed and rotted away
to practically nothing. Long ago, when the great city of Tarsis thrived as
the largest sea port in Ansalon, these sewer ways carried all the waste of
the city out to the sea, where it was washed away. When the cataclysm hit,
there was no longer a sea to wash away the waste, so the citizens built a
new aqueduct to properly dispose of waste. The old sewer ways were buried
under the rubble of the buildings lost in the cataclysm. The old sewer ways
were forgotten and left to rot beneath the rebuilt city. It was the vermin,
and low lifes who made this once proud system their homes. You stand under
an archway that leads into the sewer system. To the north you see a long
slime-covered passage that leads into the main section of the sewer ways.
To the south, you see a tunnel of sewage and waste, and on the east wall
you can see a ladder leading up to a porthole.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

    A jaded, frigid, azure sky expands above you, a swirling sea of cloud
and wind. Pummeling you from the south, glacial winds send clouds of dust
billowing around you. The howling winds scream into your ears and tear at
your clothes, as if rogue, elemental scavengers. Barren, rocky soil offers
little comfort from the relentless winds, and the only sign of life you can
see are deep wagon ruts on this well-travelled road, most of which seem to
be headed east to west, towards the city of Tarsis.

from the south as they drift violently in from the depths of the Icewall
glaciers. Clear skies expand overhead, as rain is a commodity in these
parts of Krynn. You can barely make out Tarsis, lying nestled in the heart
of the plains west from here. More dust greets you to the east.

its way east to where the dust clouds that billow about the plains

lazily in the air when you speak and breath, until a strong gust of wind
destroys them. The landscape is barren and rocky, and your feet are numb

    Stretching westward, as far as the eye can see, the great, billowing

travel. The road bends south here, starting to descend into what looks like
a dry valley. It looks almost like a canyon, as it is very dry and you can
see no plants growing. Perhaps it was a pre-cataclysm river, though
whatever ancient waters have flowed there have since dried up. The winds
from the glacier south of here die down somewhat, though a steady,
relentless northern breeze drifting from the Plains of Dust can still
readily be felt.

expand to the northwest. As you gaze over the contents of the valley, you
notice a small town nestled deep in the valley. Wisps of black smoke drift
lazily into the air, and signs of life become more apparant as there are
many visible footprints, not yet covered by dust.

    Hills rise up all around you. Gargantuan grey slabs of stone seem to
spring from the earth as the cold, snowy peaks of the Khalkists spring up
around you. Gazing to the west you notice a huge column of black smoke
rising into the air. Brilliant crimson dust spews into the air as a distant
volcano erupts. The ground shakes lightly, though it must be quite
stronger closer to the volcano. The road is barely visible now, as sheer
walls of rock flanking the bottoms of mountains are all about you.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
Summer Solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

[36mA Road in the Hills[0;37m
    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

    A flat, wavy sea of grass expands around you. Wildflowers break the

fruit trees and roses also dot this path of mulch. A cool breeze blows in
from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor, is
not far from here. In the distance to the south, beyond several foothills,
you can barely make out the towering peaks of the Khalkhist Mountains.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool

the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be
a favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from
the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the
waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies down a

    This narrow road runs north-south through the port. Cobbles have been
hastily laid in the dirt as befits a prosperous town. Narrow but tall
houses and buildings loom above you, cutting out some of the daylight that
shows the street traders in their full colours. Small children play in the
dirt and down small alleys that lead to places of ill-repute. To the north
lies the main trading square, much banter and joyous laughter are carried
on the fresh sea breeze.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mDeath Row[0;37m
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding

your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    Small pools of blood on the ground are very noticeable as they continue

torches that line each wall, ensuring a well-lit walkway. Faint sounds of
footsteps can be heard to the east, but there is nothing there but a wall.
The walls are red in tint with sigils on each side resembling the God of
Greed, Hiddukel himself. The path leads north, further into the vestibule
or south back to the entryway of the temple.

[36mEntryway of the Temple[0;37m
    This is the entryway to the temple. It is lit dimly by a few scattered
torches, which barely reflect off what appears to be the remains of several
humans. Perhaps now is a good time to turn and head back out the Red Door
south of here leading back out of this grim place. The path extends to the
north, while to the east lies a plain wooden door.

[36mOutside the Evil Temple[0;37m
    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    To the north lies the evil temple of Hiddukel, a black foreboding
building. You feel the holiness and all good drain from you, along with
your blood at the noises that come from inside. The buildings on either
side of you seem to close in, a feeling of claustrophobia fills your head
and makes you spin. You run towards the temple.

death and scratches guarding against spirits adorn the doors of many small
houses. They are all shuttered up and silent. The executioners block is to
the south.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

one must remain wary of the constant flow of smugglers and thieves that
call this town home. Known for its bawdy taverns, black markets and
expansive slums, Balifor is not home for the meek.

    An intersection is due west, where a large highway leads into the
bustling port city of Port Balifor just to the south and on to the west
through the lands of Khur. The road leads also east, becoming more of a
path, through the Balifor Steppes towards the eastern lands of Ansalon.

[36mCutting Across the Balifor Steppes[0;37m
    With the hustle and bustle of Balifor to your west, you find yourself
at the edge of the desert plains. The road beneath your feet is nothing
more than packed dirt, created over the years by the thousands of
travellers that have walked this path before you. Sparse vegetation and a
lack of trees make your journey a rather mundane one. A faint breeze
rustles the high grass around the road and ruffles your hair.

Scuffling your feet as you trudge along sends dust plumes into the air,
causing you to squint. The monotonous plains stretch out before you, and
your unchanging surroundings lull you into a very relaxed state. The path
continues to the east and south.

walk on, you decide a firm road is desired more than the alternative of a
muddy track. Humming softly, you continue on your journey. The path leads
north and west.

constant, with little change that you can see. If there is any life in
these plains, you've seen no sign of it. You idly pluck a nearby strand of
grass, rolling it between your fingers. A light wind swirls in the air, and
you continue on. The road runs north and south.

    You have reached a crossroads of sorts. A small path leads off to the

food makes your stomach rumble. Somewhere to the south lies the port town
of Balifor.

     Breaking off the main road, your eyes perceive an arid desert of
immense proportions. The air is thick and heavy with obscene amounts of
heat, causing your line of sight to ripple in the distance. A slight wind
blows in from the south, most likely from the Southern Courrain Ocean.
However, it offers no relief - just more stale, dry air.

thin, spidery pockets of sand drawn up towards the sky in the buffeting
winds. Here you can almost smell somthing different in the air, perhaps
bordering between freshly killed food, and the old stench of death.

A small firepit has been dug in the center of the room, although you can't
be sure what the inhabitant would be burning in it as fuel. In fact, you
can't be sure what purpose there is in having a fire here. Only a small
round hole at the top of the hut exists as a means of escape for the
smoke.

     Random knicknacks and assorted items of unknown origin are strewn
about the room here. A large patchwork of rotting, green canvas lines the
walls. Crates and boxes most likely containing even more useless material
join the clutter on the floor and on top of each other. Much of the long
decayed horde seems to be the sort of thing one would expect to find after
days of aimlessly searching the desert; the result of scavenging the dead
bodies of adventurers such as yourself.

     Either the space here was not needed anymore, or the Brogs
responsible for building the room just became lazy and stopped. By the
thick layer of sand on the tools and unfinished clay, you can tell that it
has been quite some time since anything has bothered with this area. A
large pile of hardened sand sits in the back of the room, unused in the
construction. A few tools are also scattered about, long forgotten by

hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

[36mThe Bank of Balifor[0;37m
    The bank of Balifor looks fairly rundown. Not surprising, since the
local populace doesn't earn enough money to bother putting it in banks.
Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window and
door, looks enthusiastic enough. A small sign has been stuck to the desk.

your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Here, off in one corner of the street, you stand before the facade of a
very evil looking temple. The walls are made from some kind of a black
stone, carved and inlaid with red in such a way as to suggest flowing
blood. Even the guards of Balifor give a wide berth to the temple, having
little interest in dealing with the wrath of the priests of Hiddukel. The
great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and
the knocker seems to be made of bone.

    Reaching a bend in the walkway there is a huge steel door to the south.
It is apparent that whatever lies south isn't meant for everyone to
experience save those with access to open this huge door. At glance the
north passage doesn't seem like more than a few people can enter at once.
An obscure walkway leads east of here.

great basalt door to the north is decorated extensively with skulls, and

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.
