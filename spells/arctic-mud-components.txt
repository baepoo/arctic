Components - New System Implemented late 2001/ early 2002
Yes I know they laod in various places, I just put a note of where i loaded them *shrug*

OK... slight change.. 2 parts.. first part is spell and the components needed..
second part is the 'ID's' of the component if I have them and info on the component.
People are starting to help with the component list, so I don't have as much info on everything.
